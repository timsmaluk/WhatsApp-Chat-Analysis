[4/10/17, 7:23:40 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya what happened?
[4/10/17, 7:25:49 AM] Owen Gilbert: Damn, I'm sorry man, ya vent all you want, that's what we are here for
[4/10/17, 7:26:23 AM] Dev Naik: Thanks Tim and Mohit. We are in great terms and we still are going to be great friends, but it just sucks because we both still love each other and we both still know that. Pretty much after her other relationship she didn't have much time to find who she was in college before pretty much getting together with me. She really needs to find who she is because she only knows half of her...
[4/10/17, 7:26:44 AM] Dev Naik: Thanks Owen
[4/10/17, 7:29:10 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahh damn dude.
[4/10/17, 7:29:24 AM] Dev Naik: We both still have a strong bond, but moving to college, she wasn't allowed enough time to find out why or how she changed. And I don't want to dwell on this but there is still is a chance that after she find out who she has become and has time for herself we still have the possibility to get together again because to be honest I love her
[4/10/17, 7:30:07 AM] Mohit Veligenti: It's great that you guys are still great friends though.
[4/10/17, 7:30:36 AM] Dev Naik: Ya it's going to be hard though seeing her and not being able to be what we were
[4/10/17, 7:30:45 AM] Chris Cheng: Man, Dev i'm sorry to hear that bro.
[4/10/17, 7:31:08 AM] Dev Naik: I don't know man I just really miss all you guys more than ever right now, and I really really want to come home..
[4/10/17, 7:31:14 AM] Dev Naik: Thanks Chris
[4/10/17, 7:32:51 AM] Owen Gilbert: That's understandable. And ya that's better than not being on good terms. Should make this summer for the guys though. Get your mind off things for a few months. See what happens, what you and her feel about things
[4/10/17, 7:35:37 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I agree to what Owen says. And dev we really miss you too buddy. Month and a half and we all back at home and we can chill and shit for sure.
[4/10/17, 7:35:44 AM] Dev Naik: Thanks Owen, I can't wait for summer

She will need her time and it will be hard to not be with her, but you will see how to grow as well in the meantime. And I am always here if you need more time to talk
[4/10/17, 9:18:51 AM] Dev Naik: Thanks Ethan, that's very true and I appreciate it a lot
[4/10/17, 9:40:04 AM] Dustin Bradley: Bro Dev I'm sorry that happened I know u really like her and that its going to be a hard month an half but we all know from ur personality u can definitely pull through the hardships that lay ahead u  they will be difficult I won't lie to u but it can be feasible

And they're all rich pleasanton kids so they've got all these expensive cameras now, probably a few other kids with drones. So I'm not doubting that the production is going to be insane

[4/11/17, 3:49:21 PM] Owen Gilbert: Take it as that's our legacy. That's what we started and left behind

[4/21/17, 1:12:42 PM] Chase Larsen: That doesn't say anything you how many people didn't vote for him in
[4/21/17, 1:12:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hillary is a beautiful woman who is the rightful air to the thrown
[4/21/17, 1:13:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ikkk but this is how it could look to other countries
[4/21/17, 1:13:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That spelling doe
[4/21/17, 1:13:21 PM] Chase Larsen: I'm gonna bring in Hillary cause she has done some sketch stuff, same with Bill hahah

[4/21/17, 1:14:15 PM] Chase Larsen: No where even close ahah
[4/21/17, 1:14:28 PM] Cameron Freeman: If she didn't make the calls she did we wouldn't of had that movie 13 hours and it was soooo good
[4/21/17, 1:14:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly?
[4/21/17, 1:17:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hillary took so much money from corporations and other countries that do stuff that she is against in her campaign. You can't say she is an angel lol.
[4/21/17, 1:18:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: I never called her an angel
[4/21/17, 1:18:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: But regardless she's irrelevant she shouldn't have been brought up
[4/21/17, 1:18:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: We are done talking about Saint Hillary
[4/21/17, 1:18:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You literally just called her a Saint lol
[4/21/17, 1:18:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: That is no way to talk to our mother
[4/21/17, 1:19:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: A saint and angel are too different things
[4/21/17, 1:19:15 PM] Chase Larsen: But why shouldn't she get brought up if she has been a huge political figure in America like trump
[4/21/17, 1:19:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: She's more like the Evil Godmother
[4/21/17, 1:19:17 PM] Cameron Freeman: Pablo is not an angel
[4/21/17, 1:19:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: But a saint
[4/21/17, 1:19:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: Cuz she's not?
[4/21/17, 1:19:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: She has nothing to do with the US rn
[4/21/17, 1:19:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: She is no one
[4/21/17, 1:19:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Other countries don't look at us and see her they see trump
[4/21/17, 1:19:53 PM] Chase Larsen: So the last 30 years of her working is nothing?
[4/21/17, 1:20:28 PM] Cameron Freeman: If we talk about the last 30 years we can talk about anyone who worked in the whithouse for 30 years and blame them too 😑😑😑
[4/21/17, 1:20:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: As of now
[4/21/17, 1:20:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: She is irrelevant
[4/21/17, 1:21:05 PM] Chase Larsen: I didn't blame her
[4/21/17, 1:21:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: She isn't. Her policies that she enacted are still in place lol
[4/21/17, 1:21:11 PM] Cameron Freeman: U did

[4/21/17, 1:21:49 PM] Chase Larsen: No I said that people in other countries with a brain don't think that all Americans are like trump or Hillary
[4/21/17, 1:21:52 PM] Cameron Freeman: @chase
[4/21/17, 1:22:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah why u bring up Hillary
[4/21/17, 1:22:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Trump is our president

[4/21/17, 1:27:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You just removed him, you obviously don't respect it lol
[4/21/17, 1:27:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: I'm sorry but that's not an opinion
[4/21/17, 1:28:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: So I just looked up the definition of opinion and I stand corrected that was an opinion
[4/21/17, 1:28:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You can't pick and choose opinions lol
[4/21/17, 1:28:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: I don't respect other people opinion ☹️
[4/21/17, 1:28:41 PM] Chase Larsen: Alright let's talk about something else
[4/21/17, 1:28:49 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No wtf this is fun
[4/21/17, 1:28:56 PM] Dev Naik: Hey why can't everyone have their own opinions and be ok with it? As long as people don't attack other people then why should there be a problem?
[4/21/17, 1:28:57 PM] Chase Larsen: There seems to be some tension haha
[4/21/17, 1:28:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: This is amazingly fun
[4/21/17, 1:28:59 PM] Jonathan Ong: Ok I'd actually love to have this conversation this summer because the truth of the matter is the left is the real evil in this country
[4/21/17, 1:29:06 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: This is hella fucking funny
[4/21/17, 1:29:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Jon you just opened a new portal of discussion and I fucking love it
[4/21/17, 1:29:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because dev some opinions aren't okay
[4/21/17, 1:29:34 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Yesss!!!!!
[4/21/17, 1:29:50 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Lmao "some opinions aren't okay"
[4/21/17, 1:29:53 PM] Dev Naik: But you have the right to believe that and there is nothing wrong with that
[4/21/17, 1:30:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah and I also have the right to not be okay with someone opinion
[4/21/17, 1:30:09 PM] Dev Naik: But you also can't attack someone for having a specific opinion
[4/21/17, 1:30:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: There is wrong with some opinions
[4/21/17, 1:30:18 PM] Cameron Freeman: I can
[4/21/17, 1:30:18 PM] Chase Larsen: I actually agree somewhat with Jons statement
[4/21/17, 1:30:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's my right
[4/21/17, 1:30:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not a surprise
[4/21/17, 1:30:29 PM] Dev Naik: Yes I'm saying it is
[4/21/17, 1:31:06 PM] Dev Naik: But for all sides, opinions can be had but any action specifically targeting a group or a persons shouldn't be tolerated
[4/21/17, 1:31:14 PM] Jonathan Ong: Cameron u can't pick and choose what opinions u like just cuz u might feel offended by them. That is not how u have a debate about the key issues plaguing our country right now nor is that how u solve problems
[4/21/17, 1:31:19 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cameron you can hate an opinion but doesn't hurt to listen
[4/21/17, 1:31:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You have the right to not be okay with it. But to be someone that's actually putting something good into the discussion, you have to be able to change the way their opinion with your opinion. Not by disregarding their opinion completely
[4/21/17, 1:31:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Woah who said I didn't listen
[4/21/17, 1:31:41 PM] Dev Naik: Jon he can it's his right
[4/21/17, 1:32:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Whenever someone says something about trump you just throw them overboard lol.
[4/21/17, 1:32:15 PM] Dev Naik: Our troops literally fight for our country to have that right just like you have yours to your own opinion
[4/21/17, 1:32:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Example A: Jon
[4/21/17, 1:32:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hitler's opinion was that Jews and gays etc. weren't okay and that they were lesser and shouldn't be here. I'm not okay with that opinion and neither were others and action was taken against him because it
[4/21/17, 1:32:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because trump is disgusting and people who support him are also
[4/21/17, 1:32:50 PM] Jonathan Ong: U don't have to agree with an opinion but at least respect them because chances are ppl in this group will listen to u and respect what u have to say
[4/21/17, 1:32:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's my opinion
[4/21/17, 1:32:56 PM] Chase Larsen: Hey if everyone is open to opinion id like to talk to all about the church of Jesus Christ if Latter Day Saints
[4/21/17, 1:33:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kick chase
[4/21/17, 1:33:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: But I do not have to respect an opinion I think is stupid and wrong lol
[4/21/17, 1:33:27 PM] Chase Larsen: Geez wait so I can't express that opinion.
[4/21/17, 1:33:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: And tbh when u said the trump Obama thing I thought u were joking and I kicked u jokingly
[4/21/17, 1:33:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: I thought u were trying to add humor to the tense convoy
[4/21/17, 1:34:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Why can't chase say his opinion
[4/21/17, 1:34:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The country is divided because we have a two party system where the extreme left and extreme right are both annoying hobknockers
[4/21/17, 1:34:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: I thought we had to listen to people's opinions?
[4/21/17, 1:34:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: @timmy
[4/21/17, 1:34:58 PM] Chase Larsen: I was joking with my last statement, but Ethan do you should know that Mormons are normal people it seems like everytime I mention it Ethan is the first to say no hahah
[4/21/17, 1:35:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo I high key can't wait till the summer when we are all together and have this discussion

[4/21/17, 1:35:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol i just like messing with you chase
[4/21/17, 1:35:28 PM] Dev Naik: But the problem is no one is ready to listen and respect the other side without attacking people for it
[4/21/17, 1:35:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: lol
[4/21/17, 1:35:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: U just like kinda attacked people
[4/21/17, 1:35:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: U didn't give them a chance
[4/21/17, 1:35:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: To try and listen
[4/21/17, 1:36:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: U automatically assumed they wouldn't
[4/21/17, 1:36:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why does it take you 15 texts to say one thing Cam?
[4/21/17, 1:36:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I like these types of discussion, it's always fun to hear other people's opinions of things. Makes me look differently at the world
[4/21/17, 1:36:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahaha sorry
[4/21/17, 1:36:16 PM] Chase Larsen: Ok hahah that's what I thought I mean I don't take offense really. I actually kind of want to see the Book of Mormon play

[4/21/17, 1:37:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But the fact she said you're the best atudent might
[4/21/17, 1:37:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: But like I really earned it u know
[4/21/17, 1:37:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not a whole lot of people passed that class
[4/21/17, 1:38:09 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Critical thinking is how to form your own opinion lol not how to respond to others
[4/21/17, 1:38:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Cam is real good at that
[4/21/17, 1:38:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: No no no
[4/21/17, 1:38:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's about how to argue
[4/21/17, 1:38:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: And how to form arguments
[4/21/17, 1:38:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Critical thinking is everything related to arguments lol not just your own opinions
[4/21/17, 1:38:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah
[4/21/17, 1:38:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I'm trying to see where your idea of opinions and arguments comes from
[4/21/17, 1:39:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: Kinda just like
[4/21/17, 1:39:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: Living
[4/21/17, 1:39:21 PM] Cameron Freeman: I'm not being sarcastic
[4/21/17, 1:39:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: Idk lol
[4/21/17, 1:39:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cuz you make good ideas but you sometimes never have a basis behind it. And it just makes your arguments look really weak
[4/21/17, 1:39:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But sometimes you have all the facts behind it
[4/21/17, 1:39:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It confuses me
[4/21/17, 1:39:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah
[4/21/17, 1:40:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: I don't always choose to site my sources or do the work
[4/21/17, 1:40:26 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I agree with mohit it makes your arguments hard to understand
[4/21/17, 1:40:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like Hillary, sorry to bring her back up, but you never have any backup for it. Yet you will argue for days even when we present the opposing side
[4/21/17, 1:40:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And that's like a core thing in philosophy classes
[4/21/17, 1:40:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: And I use facts for some arguments that I use to create other ones so maybe they don't directly apply but it's similar and coorilates.
[4/21/17, 1:41:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah no with Hillary 97% of the time I'm jk
[4/21/17, 1:41:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: I just like to go back and forth
[4/21/17, 1:41:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like I'm not bashing you. I'm just trying to discuss legibly
[4/21/17, 1:41:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: She's clearly not a saint 😅😂😂
[4/21/17, 1:41:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Legitly*
[4/21/17, 1:41:25 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ok thank god I couldn't tell
[4/21/17, 1:41:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh ok
[4/21/17, 1:41:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: No I feel u
[4/21/17, 1:41:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya see we can't tell at all
[4/21/17, 1:41:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We really think you think of her like that
[4/21/17, 1:41:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We can't see you joking at ALL
[4/21/17, 1:42:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It seems like you'd be completely down to campaign for her and shit
[4/21/17, 1:42:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: With Hillary before though. I just didn't want people to harp on all her bad things and what she's don't wrong because of the fact it was her or trump. And Hillary on paper is the most "qualified" candidate like she's been in whitehouse and there's no doubt trump is the least. And if no one could come together and hate one person. Than I knew trump would win
[4/21/17, 1:43:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: Like I hated how Bernie supporters were still tryna vote Bernie when it was like Election Day, and I hate how third party candidates got voted for because people didn't like Hillary and not because they actually wanted the third party. Because then if everyone sees Hillary and trump as evil, the republicans are gana vote trump and the dems are split
[4/21/17, 1:43:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: And I much rather would have Hillary FORSURE
[4/21/17, 1:43:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok. I see your point.
[4/21/17, 1:44:00 PM] Cameron Freeman: Make sence? Ish
[4/21/17, 1:44:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I see where you are coming from it.
[4/21/17, 1:44:13 PM] Bryce Olson: So what about these power outages and I heard Madison lost power too
[4/21/17, 1:44:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: LOL
[4/21/17, 1:44:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But I think most people voted for 3rd party because the 2 in total sucked and nobody's opinions in the world lie FAR right or FAR left
[4/21/17, 1:44:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: WAIT WHAT SERIOSLY
[4/21/17, 1:45:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But I see what you mean by the votes for them out of spite
[4/21/17, 1:45:12 PM] Bryce Olson: Yes
[4/21/17, 1:45:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah Ik but fuck haha they should look at it as a vote against trump and not a vote for Hillary
[4/21/17, 1:45:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Damn alright see cameron. That argument made your argument seem so much more competent
[4/21/17, 1:45:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahaha ehhyyyy
[4/21/17, 1:45:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But the thing is, aren't they using that same logic against Hillary
[4/21/17, 1:46:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: We just need to have a non two party system
[4/21/17, 1:46:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^^
[4/21/17, 1:46:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^
[4/21/17, 1:46:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: What u mean?
[4/21/17, 1:46:15 PM] Chase Larsen: Seriously I agree with Ethan
[4/21/17, 1:46:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: And I never see that happening doe lol
[4/21/17, 1:46:28 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya our party system is trash
[4/21/17, 1:46:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: Tbh communism on paper sounds like perfect
[4/21/17, 1:46:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like hey, I don't like Hillary so I'm gunna vote 3rd party. Hey I don't like trump so let's vote Hillary
[4/21/17, 1:46:37 PM] Chase Larsen: I mean I voted for Gary Johnson
[4/21/17, 1:46:38 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: On paper
[4/21/17, 1:46:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: It doesn't ever work out doe
[4/21/17, 1:46:46 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nobody said communism lol
[4/21/17, 1:46:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Communism is a utopia on paper
[4/21/17, 1:46:59 PM] Chase Larsen: He's a serious candidate that people should've listened to more
[4/21/17, 1:47:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True chase.
[4/21/17, 1:47:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Bernie would have been a great candidate too honestly y
[4/21/17, 1:47:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Even though he was very liberal
[4/21/17, 1:47:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He had better ideas than both of them too. And doesn't have scandal
[4/21/17, 1:47:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Even some ideas were outlandish
[4/21/17, 1:48:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And I didn't agree with half his campaign
[4/21/17, 1:48:05 PM] Chase Larsen: It's true he was just a nice old guy
[4/21/17, 1:48:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: No cuz the republicans just wanted the power back. Like trump was always gana be republican candidate. But with democracts. The majority were Bernie supporters. And when u have a party split like that. When only half vote for Hillary and the Bernie supporters don't vote for her. U have all the republicans voting for trump and ofcourse maybe some didn't but more dems who wanted Bernie didn't vote
[4/21/17, 1:48:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya. I mean that's politics. You can't unite so many people so easily
[4/21/17, 1:48:55 PM] Chase Larsen: But I don't really agree with Bernies policy
[4/21/17, 1:48:59 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya it's just politics
[4/21/17, 1:49:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya. True. All his policies weren't golden

[4/21/17, 1:49:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya.
[4/21/17, 1:49:57 PM] Chase Larsen: Why couldn't Gary get in man he was like the only candidate who wanted space exploration like I know it's expensive but I totally think we should
[4/21/17, 1:50:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But hey, see how once you start a civil damn discussion nobody is going against each other. WE SHOULD DO THIS EVERYTIME GOD DAMN IT
[4/21/17, 1:50:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Imma go take a triple shot and start studying for class
[4/21/17, 1:50:32 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: People are so easily triggered
[4/21/17, 1:50:49 PM] Jonathan Ong: Hillary should be in jail tbh lol. Her emails, Benghazi, taking money from the Clinton foundation.. not to mention the overarching fact that she is a corrupt lying whore. She doesn't care about women's rights nor cares about creating jobs for the working class. All she cares about is appeasing to the so called "victims" of society such as black ppl or muslims just to get there vote. She only cares about herself and taking money from all the lobbyists while keeping bureaucrats in control with all their stupid regulations and taxes
[4/21/17, 1:50:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: Sorry Trump is a soar subject for me
[4/21/17, 1:51:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: I don't think we can call her a whore

[5/1/17, 10:41:31 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah ours was better ahah
[5/1/17, 10:42:43 PM] Owen Gilbert: I'm surprised they didn't have anyone with a better drone. They still went with a gopro attached to an old phantom. Which by my standards now, is crap lol
[5/1/17, 10:43:46 PM] Owen Gilbert: Plus I liked the editing on ours better, I liked out credits that had the drone footage in the background, theirs was plain tacky flip text with no audio
[5/1/17, 10:44:11 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah I feel
Like song choice could've been better too
[5/1/17, 10:44:16 PM] Chris Cheng: Just saw the video. Was pretty trash compared to ours
[5/1/17, 10:44:18 PM] Chris Cheng: Ngl
[5/1/17, 10:44:58 PM] Owen Gilbert: Ya chase, again it was based around "equality" so all the songs I guess we're based around that
[5/1/17, 10:45:03 PM] Owen Gilbert: Were
[5/1/17, 10:45:56 PM] Chase Larsen: Man it's a high school lip dub it already has a bunch of people trying to get a message or their emotion in hahah
[5/1/17, 10:46:42 PM] Chase Larsen: It's just like have fun and go crazy the message behind it isn't bad it just doesn't need it really in my opinion
[5/1/17, 10:46:56 PM] Chase Larsen: Like our drone shot was waaaaaayyy better
[5/1/17, 10:48:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Owen, they didn't even turn the audio off wtf
[5/1/17, 10:48:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: They just turned it down
[5/1/17, 10:48:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like lowered the volume.
[5/1/17, 10:48:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I can't
[5/1/17, 10:49:21 PM] Owen Gilbert: Yes haha, I talked to moshtagh about it a while ago and they would only make another lip dup if it had a message, mosh being part of the gsa club, thought it should be about equality
[5/1/17, 10:50:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Geez. I mean it's cool. Equality and all. But angsty teenagers and political standpoints don't mix well.
[5/1/17, 10:50:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Zichey was wearing a fuck Donald trump shirt. I was like man get the fuck out lol
[5/1/17, 10:50:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It's a school spirit fun video lol like come on zach

[5/1/17, 10:53:18 PM] Owen Gilbert: Right?? In general I thought it would have been better, I mentioned I met the news people when I visited and they were very good with filmmaking
[5/1/17, 10:53:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don't think it was the film people
[5/1/17, 10:53:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cuz it would've been WAYYY better than that
[5/1/17, 10:53:45 PM] Owen Gilbert: Exactly, which is weird
[5/1/17, 10:53:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That or the school just didn't wanna do any retakes at all
[5/1/17, 10:54:14 PM] Dev Naik: I'm all about expression and shit but I do see that it's just for school spirt. But with that being said, why not be able to express your feelings? I think if you are trying to express your feelings about a certain thing don't represent it from the school keep things on topic for the school's spirit
[5/1/17, 10:55:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That was aight, i liked how they were obvious with the different groups but there was too much extra shit and it was long affffff
[5/1/17, 10:55:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Does anyone have our video?
[5/1/17, 10:57:04 PM] Owen Gilbert: It's on vimeo somewhere, I'll try to find it, but also hella people were jumping in front of the camera, can even see the lip dubbers got annoyed with it, and they had the camera guy going backwards instead of the other way
[5/1/17, 10:57:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeahhh

[5/1/17, 11:15:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So doesn't matter
[5/1/17, 11:15:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wanted to fuck with the breakers but it's outside and he would hear me

[5/1/17, 11:38:50 PM] ‎Joe Stine changed this group's icon
[5/1/17, 11:39:05 PM] Joe Stine: I don't know how anyone didn't notice that before.

[5/2/17, 3:04:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Come on, that was a prime jew joke
[5/2/17, 3:05:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How should i know if my ancestors are gingers
[5/2/17, 3:05:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ancestry.com
[5/2/17, 3:05:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Heard it's pretty useful
[5/2/17, 3:06:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats how I know I am for sure am from jewish heritage
[5/2/17, 3:12:54 PM] Dustin Bradley: Fuck u guys the broncos need a better run game Jamal Charles is perfect 👌🏻
[5/2/17, 3:13:09 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Watch him get injured in preseason
[5/2/17, 3:13:18 PM] Dustin Bradley: Go team go go go
[5/2/17, 3:15:05 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well that would mean we have no run game and basically forfeit the game because our offense stinks
[5/2/17, 3:17:28 PM] Dustin Bradley: Unless Trevor Siemion can pull a Tom Brady throughout the season
[5/2/17, 3:17:45 PM] Dustin Bradley: We're good 😊
[5/2/17, 3:19:46 PM] Dev Naik: Bro how about that 49ers draft though!!!

[5/2/17, 6:19:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Can't make the argument when you've never had one cam
[5/2/17, 6:19:21 PM] Joe Stine: Inb4 apple exit scams and only thing left is android.
[5/2/17, 6:19:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^
[5/2/17, 6:19:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I got my old phone as a backup
[5/2/17, 6:19:48 PM] Cameron Freeman: Awakward an android was my first phone
[5/2/17, 6:19:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: I had a palm pree
[5/2/17, 6:19:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: And then I had an HTC HERO
[5/2/17, 6:20:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: When in like 6th grade?
[5/2/17, 6:20:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I'm talking newest ones lol.
[5/2/17, 6:20:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: No
[5/2/17, 6:20:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: I didn't get an iPhone until sophomore year in highscool
[5/2/17, 6:20:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: I hate my hero freshmen year
[5/2/17, 6:20:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: Had*
[5/2/17, 6:20:52 PM] Joe Stine: Tell apple to fix their warranty policies then I'd go with apple again smh. Went through 3 iPhone 6's
[5/2/17, 6:21:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Htc is trash as fuck though you can't compare that.
[5/2/17, 6:21:12 PM] Joe Stine: Couldn't handle all the porn and dank memes.
[5/2/17, 6:21:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Get a Samsung s8 and you'll probably think it's better
[5/2/17, 6:21:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's ur fault joe
[5/2/17, 6:21:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: I had a 4s for all of highscool lol
[5/2/17, 6:21:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: And even some of freshmen year in college
[5/2/17, 6:22:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: Nahhh iPhone gang for life
[5/2/17, 6:23:09 PM] Dev Naik: GANG GANG
[5/2/17, 6:23:48 PM] Owen Gilbert: IPhone 8 will have wireless charging finally, and Apple will call it breakthrough technology
[5/2/17, 6:24:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^
[5/2/17, 6:24:23 PM] Owen Gilbert: And innovative
[5/2/17, 6:24:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Apple is just taking old tech, releasing it to the sheeple saying it's new.
[5/2/17, 6:24:39 PM] Owen Gilbert: "Courage"
[5/2/17, 6:24:48 PM] Joe Stine: Like the water resistance....
[5/2/17, 6:24:54 PM] Joe Stine: It was "new"
[5/2/17, 6:24:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I'll give the iPhone one thing. The battery like is fucking phenomenal. But that's cuz the software is not heavy.
[5/2/17, 6:25:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Such haters
[5/2/17, 6:25:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Life*
[5/2/17, 6:26:51 PM] Owen Gilbert: Apple takes old tech, adds their own expensove touch to it and call it new and innovative. The iPhone 8 is supposed to have a full screen display though, no bezles at all, again took it from galaxy, but it will be better
[5/2/17, 6:28:15 PM] Owen Gilbert: It's speculated that if the tech is here by the time of the release, the fingerprint reader will be built into the screen, so they can take off the bottom chin and make it all screen
[5/2/17, 6:29:50 PM] Owen Gilbert: I'll admit that the iPhone is faster and has better battery life, but that's only because it's so simple. Most Android phones have features packed inside, which can get annoying because half of them I don't use
[5/2/17, 6:30:37 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hey Friday
[5/2/17, 6:30:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: Who's free

[5/2/17, 6:33:54 PM] Dustin Bradley: 👍🏻
[5/2/17, 6:38:16 PM] Cameron Freeman: 😧
[5/2/17, 6:38:40 PM] Bryce Olson: Lol
[5/2/17, 11:33:31 PM] Owen Gilbert: Alright, WTF. Travis' dad just bought a fucking stingray
[5/2/17, 11:33:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: I thought he lost his job and they had money issues?
[5/2/17, 11:34:12 PM] Owen Gilbert: Well apparently not
[5/2/17, 11:34:26 PM] Dev Naik: Ya I saw that!
[5/2/17, 11:34:40 PM] Owen Gilbert: They apparently have enough money to pay for Travis and all his needs as well
[5/2/17, 11:34:58 PM] Owen Gilbert: Because he STILL DOESN'T HAVE A JOB
[5/2/17, 11:35:14 PM] Owen Gilbert: And he's 21 NEXT MONTH
[5/2/17, 11:35:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: This month
[5/2/17, 11:35:41 PM] Owen Gilbert: THIS MONTH
[5/2/17, 11:35:52 PM] Owen Gilbert: 18 DAYS
[5/2/17, 11:36:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Aye. He's not in the chat.  He doesn't talk to us anymore. He doesn't care about us. We don't really care about him. Let's just not give a fuck lol.
[5/2/17, 11:40:35 PM] Owen Gilbert: Kosta told me that raveena messaged him. She has been Travis' closest friend for the past few months. She told him that she can't deal with Travis anymore. That she's literally emailed her resume for Travis to use as a guide, but he's a lazy selfish looser. Pissed me off because I worked my ass off this past week, worked 8 hours everyday. And I see that car on his Snapchat
[5/2/17, 11:41:25 PM] Owen Gilbert: Enjoy today's segment "you know what grinds my gears" brought to you by Owen
[5/2/17, 11:43:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lolll
[5/2/17, 11:44:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And I feel you though dude. And I understand the envy the annoyance and the confusion of Travis, but it's like, he's gunna be 21 soon. Then 22. Then 26 then 30. Just gunna keep going. It's not like his parents can support him forever.
[5/2/17, 11:45:12 PM] Owen Gilbert: Well we don't know that lol
[5/2/17, 11:45:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And you're grinding to get your shit up. So I mean. There's no point. Because you always gotta look at that future value.
[5/2/17, 11:46:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean ya. Maybe they can. But the fact that he can't even support himself as a person makes him look even worse. Now is understandable since he's a student. But past it, it makes no sense
[5/2/17, 11:48:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Also. His dad bought a sting ray, which means he's planning for his retirement. Meaning he's not trying to Travis around to do whatever the fuck he wants.
[5/2/17, 11:48:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Trying to keep*
[5/2/17, 11:49:06 PM] Owen Gilbert: It's just sad. And so pathetic. He will push everyone away from him because of his stubbornness. That's what he did with me, kosta, that group and now ravina
[5/2/17, 11:50:16 PM] Bryce Olson: That sucks man he is honestly a dam ass !
[5/2/17, 11:50:34 PM] Owen Gilbert: He's the most stubborn, selfish, laziest bastard I've ever seen. It's like unfathomable how much of and ass he is
[5/2/17, 11:50:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya it is. But I mean he's an adult if he can't see it. Then no one can help him outta that. It's his fault. He's gotta step up sometime.
[5/2/17, 11:50:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We can't do anything about it
[5/2/17, 11:51:27 PM] Bryce Olson: Ur right Mohit
[5/2/17, 11:52:23 PM] Dev Naik: Ya I know ir sucks Owen, but keeping poison on your mind won't help, I'm with Mohit, you have to forget about him even though it's hard
[5/2/17, 11:54:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya. Like you grind. You keep doing your shit. Thinking about someone doing the opposite of you makes no sense. Unless you truly care about him and want to help him. Which you said you don't wanna do because you can't deal with him.
[5/2/17, 11:55:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Right?
[5/2/17, 11:55:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And of course I'm not saying you shouldn't vent about him. But it seems more like you keep it on your mind more often that it should be.
[5/2/17, 11:55:52 PM] Dustin Bradley: Agreed I think we should just drop this issue altogether because it makes us look worse than he does if we continue letting his irritating personality get the best of us
[5/2/17, 11:56:43 PM] Owen Gilbert: I had this talk before and i hang done anything for me to move on. You guys all have lives at school, other friends. I've been stuck at home and work with nothing but me myself and I and my thoughts. I haven't hung out with any coworkers outside of work so I don't really have a life outside ptown. I moved and my life went on pause. I'm trying to do stuff but there hasn't been anything that's my life back into motion. And so that shit still stirs in my mind and I hate it
[5/2/17, 11:56:58 PM] Owen Gilbert: I haven't*
[5/3/17, 12:06:37 AM] Dustin Bradley: Owen u make your own luck and success it does not just come to u and that's exactly why I think travis's lifestyle bugs u so much because u r envious of him receiving thing even though he puts no effort or thought into doing those things. BUT!! let me tell u my friend that is not how the cookie crumbles. It may seem like Travis is happy living a freeloader life however the world will flip a 180 on him and it will catch him with his pants down (no pun intended) anyways from what he receives now will later hurt him in the future think of it like that Owen and leave it behind. let him get fuck by the world not U!!!
[5/3/17, 12:53:02 AM] Owen Gilbert: Thanks Dustin. I just gotta keep working towards something

[6/5/17, 12:54:29 PM] Chris Cheng: I can hoop anytime
[6/5/17, 12:54:44 PM] Chris Cheng: But i thought we said Tuesday around 7:30?
[6/5/17, 12:54:45 PM] Joe Stine: Wanna ball tonight?
[6/5/17, 12:54:52 PM] Chris Cheng: Sure joe im down
[6/5/17, 12:55:21 PM] Joe Stine: If Chase can get the church, I can probably get Karl and his brother to come to run 5's

[6/5/17, 12:56:31 PM] Chris Cheng: Is this for tuesday?
[6/5/17, 12:57:03 PM] Owen Gilbert: Aight aight aight, random but, Apple just announced a portable home speaker that has siri. Basically apples version of Google home and the Amazon echo lol. If that doesn't show apples willingness to copy companies and call it innovative, idk what else does
[6/5/17, 12:57:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: Thought it was 6 Tuesday?
[6/5/17, 12:57:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: And I'm down tonight also
[6/5/17, 12:57:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But then again, a home system is not really copying more creating their own version. We gotta see what it can do since apple has no home connectivity
[6/5/17, 12:57:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: And Owen please stfu hahaha
[6/5/17, 12:57:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya I'm down for tonight
[6/5/17, 12:57:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Thank you
[6/5/17, 12:58:01 PM] Chris Cheng: Apple prolly just wants to compete with them so it came out with one. Its the same thing for instagram and facebook copying the stories

[6/5/17, 12:58:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya

[6/12/17, 8:55:21 PM] Chris Cheng: Kyrie is my 2nd favorite player
[6/12/17, 8:55:24 PM] Chase Larsen: 73 points in China

[6/12/17, 8:57:41 PM] Chase Larsen: I thought people liked him I mean I liked how he handled the Donald sterling issue
[6/12/17, 8:57:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's all about the journey to the ring not just having one
[6/12/17, 8:57:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I like Sliver
[6/12/17, 8:57:57 PM] Chris Cheng: 🖕u
[6/12/17, 8:57:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fucking Zaza with that random ass flag
[6/12/17, 8:58:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: Kevin's journey is weak
[6/12/17, 8:58:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Journey don't mean shit to HoF

[6/12/17, 8:58:55 PM] Chase Larsen: No it doesn't there's no where in the books that say you got a ring but it was weak
[6/12/17, 8:58:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ur saying if mc cow stayed in the warriors and they won like 10 more championships he would be in hall of fame
[6/12/17, 8:59:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He was never gonna win with OKC
[6/12/17, 8:59:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes he could have
‎[6/12/17, 8:59:20 PM] Joe Stine: ‎image omitted
[6/12/17, 8:59:21 PM] Cameron Freeman: OKC has a great team
[6/12/17, 8:59:28 PM] Chris Cheng: No he couldnt

[6/12/17, 8:59:32 PM] Chase Larsen: Okc had a great team
[6/12/17, 8:59:42 PM] Chris Cheng: Westbrook is not as efficient as steph curry
[6/12/17, 8:59:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I didn't say that rings mattered, I am saying that the fact you have them matters more than the way you got it
[6/12/17, 8:59:45 PM] Chase Larsen: Then they lost harden
[6/12/17, 8:59:51 PM] Chris Cheng: And OKC dont have other role players
[6/12/17, 9:00:18 PM] Cameron Freeman: That don't make no damn sense Ethan lol
[6/12/17, 9:00:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It does actually lol
[6/12/17, 9:00:32 PM] Joe Stine: Durant could have gone to Washington his home town with wall and beal. Instead he chose the warriors arguably  the best team ever in nba history
[6/12/17, 9:00:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I would
[6/12/17, 9:00:44 PM] Joe Stine: So he's a 🐍
[6/12/17, 9:00:44 PM] Cameron Freeman: EXACLTY
[6/12/17, 9:01:22 PM] Chris Cheng: Why wouldnt he? If there is a chance to be with a better team, in order to win, thats the more obvious choice
[6/12/17, 9:01:23 PM] Chase Larsen: So they are the best team ever
[6/12/17, 9:01:28 PM] Joe Stine: Yeah it's a smart business decision, but bitch move.
[6/12/17, 9:01:37 PM] Chris Cheng: Business is business
[6/12/17, 9:01:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's like de la sale always beating foothill every year in championship then senior year transferring to de la sale and winning
[6/12/17, 9:01:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's ducked up
[6/12/17, 9:01:44 PM] Chris Cheng: Thats what the nba is about
[6/12/17, 9:01:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its a business, high school is high school
[6/12/17, 9:02:02 PM] Chris Cheng: KD is MVP too
[6/12/17, 9:02:05 PM] Chris Cheng: 🖕🖕🖕
[6/12/17, 9:02:07 PM] Cameron Freeman: Oh stop

[6/12/17, 9:02:11 PM] Joe Stine: What happened to being competitive though. That's why ratings went down.
[6/12/17, 9:02:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Kevin would of had more money on any other team
[6/12/17, 9:02:17 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's business
[6/12/17, 9:02:20 PM] Chase Larsen: I guess you do t like capitalism huh joe
[6/12/17, 9:02:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why should the players care
[6/12/17, 9:02:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Winning a ring > money
[6/12/17, 9:02:41 PM] Joe Stine: Yes Chase im a communist deport me
[6/12/17, 9:02:45 PM] Chase Larsen: Hahaha
[6/12/17, 9:02:50 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Alright boys we got him
[6/12/17, 9:02:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: Y'all are trippin
[6/12/17, 9:02:58 PM] Chris Cheng: As a player who already makes a lot of money, it makes more sense to chase rings rather than money
[6/12/17, 9:02:59 PM] Chase Larsen: I mean your the one that said you don't like it
[6/12/17, 9:03:09 PM] Chase Larsen: ^
[6/12/17, 9:03:17 PM] Chris Cheng: Its called a trade off cameron
[6/12/17, 9:03:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly chris
[6/12/17, 9:03:20 PM] Joe Stine: You Chase rings when you're in last season like David west. Not like kd in his prime.
[6/12/17, 9:03:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: EXACLTY ^
[6/12/17, 9:03:33 PM] Chris Cheng: Or opportunity cost
[6/12/17, 9:03:35 PM] Chase Larsen: Why would t you Chase rings in your prime
[6/12/17, 9:03:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thank you chase
[6/12/17, 9:03:50 PM] Joe Stine: Because you actually earn it.
[6/12/17, 9:03:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: U should be good enough to actually earn them
[6/12/17, 9:03:53 PM] Chase Larsen: Why would you wait your whole career to win a ring that doesn't make any sense
[6/12/17, 9:04:01 PM] Chase Larsen: If you could win it go and win it
[6/12/17, 9:04:01 PM] Chris Cheng: Exactly chase
[6/12/17, 9:04:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Scoring 30+ in every finals game doesnt sound bad to me
[6/12/17, 9:04:31 PM] Chris Cheng: ^^^
[6/12/17, 9:05:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: Here is the deal. U can work hard and grind until u make it and get what U want knowing u gave it ur al and keep trying till u get it. Or u can basically be handed everything. Being someone who worked for everything he has I think it's pathetic kd was basically handed a championship
‎[6/12/17, 9:05:32 PM] Joe Stine: ‎image omitted
[6/12/17, 9:05:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: And even though he did very well. Look at every game he didn't play and they won without him
[6/12/17, 9:06:20 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol Hillary was anti gay marriage and then she changed her view
[6/12/17, 9:06:23 PM] Chris Cheng: Whats the point of doing so much hard work if you're not achieving ur goal?
[6/12/17, 9:06:46 PM] Chris Cheng: If there is a more efficient way, why wouldnt u take that opportunity?
[6/12/17, 9:06:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: Omg that's such a false analogy fallacy chase
[6/12/17, 9:06:58 PM] Chase Larsen: Look it up Cameron
[6/12/17, 9:06:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: I totally get where ur coming at chris now
[6/12/17, 9:07:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Not really cam
[6/12/17, 9:07:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Chris*
[6/12/17, 9:07:18 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No cam your wrong
[6/12/17, 9:07:40 PM] Chase Larsen: "Fake news" hahahah
[6/12/17, 9:07:51 PM] Chris Cheng: I'm proud of KD. No matter how the journey was. He ended up finishing and achieving his goal. For that I'm proud of him
[6/12/17, 9:07:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: FAKE NEWS
[6/12/17, 9:08:03 PM] Chris Cheng: And also, because he's my favorite player
[6/12/17, 9:08:08 PM] Chase Larsen: I agree Chris
[6/12/17, 9:08:16 PM] Joe Stine: It's the fact when the term "if you can't beat em join em" turns into reality.
[6/12/17, 9:08:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: Sorry phone died
[6/12/17, 9:08:50 PM] Chris Cheng: Then that's an issue for the NBA to handle
[6/12/17, 9:09:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: And yes. That's comparing two completely different things that have nothing in common
[6/12/17, 9:09:05 PM] Chase Larsen: I would love to see you guys in KDs position in the offseason
[6/12/17, 9:09:11 PM] Joe Stine: Nba only handles issues with Chris Paul.
[6/12/17, 9:09:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Chase that is every super star ever
[6/12/17, 9:09:17 PM] Joe Stine: That's why we won't get him.
[6/12/17, 9:09:33 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Then what is the issue cam?
[6/12/17, 9:09:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If it is every superstar
[6/12/17, 9:09:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: No I'm saying every super star CAN do that
[6/12/17, 9:10:21 PM] Chris Cheng: Then it's the NBA's fault for not patching up this loophole
[6/12/17, 9:10:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: They have all been in his "position"
[6/12/17, 9:10:25 PM] Chris Cheng: Not KD's
[6/12/17, 9:10:26 PM] Chase Larsen: Your not a super star you guys wouldn't know what it's like to give your all
To a community and team with not the best management and get to the finals and lose. If you had a chance to get a ring you would do it to
[6/12/17, 9:10:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Chase are you in Utah already or are you still here
[6/12/17, 9:10:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: Then go to wizards not warriors
[6/12/17, 9:10:55 PM] Chase Larsen: I'm still here
[6/12/17, 9:10:56 PM] Chris Cheng: Warriors are better than wizards
[6/12/17, 9:10:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Cuse the wizards did so much
[6/12/17, 9:11:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I would absolutely go to the best team
[6/12/17, 9:11:16 PM] Chris Cheng: Smart decision is warriors
[6/12/17, 9:11:22 PM] Chris Cheng: Yea^
[6/12/17, 9:11:38 PM] Chase Larsen: I just learned to
Appreciate players and the game and it's been so much better to
Watch
[6/12/17, 9:11:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^
[6/12/17, 9:11:50 PM] Chase Larsen: Like if the cavs won I would have been happy to
[6/12/17, 9:12:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[6/12/17, 9:12:21 PM] Chase Larsen: Kyrie is amazing and Lebron had gone to
The finals 7 straight times that's amazing who cares what you say that's legendary
[6/12/17, 9:12:33 PM] Chris Cheng: ^^^
[6/12/17, 9:13:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: KD made an easy decision and it got him a championship good for him. My bottom line is that it wasn't a respectable one.
[6/12/17, 9:13:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: I me Cameron doesn't respect him for it
[6/12/17, 9:13:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Fair enough
[6/12/17, 9:14:10 PM] Chase Larsen: I get that you don't respect him that's fine but he earned the championship and finals MVP we can agree on that
[6/12/17, 9:14:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You can say that you dont like it, but you cant say he shouldnt have
[6/12/17, 9:14:53 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah I agree Ethan
[6/12/17, 9:19:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hey we can agree on one thing. All these bandwagons on Snapchat and insta are annoying as shit
[6/12/17, 9:19:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ehhh I wouldn't say he earned it but we can agree to disagree
[6/12/17, 9:19:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes
[6/12/17, 9:19:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Omg Cam. You are just being spitefull
[6/12/17, 9:19:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Spiteful*
[6/12/17, 9:19:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: No I'm dead ass
[6/12/17, 9:20:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: 5 30+ point games is pretty fucking hard to do
[6/12/17, 9:20:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: If kobe did that I'd loose all respect
[6/12/17, 9:20:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kobe was on the right team lol
[6/12/17, 9:20:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: We had hella tough years
[6/12/17, 9:20:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: But say he wasn't and he left I wouldn't respect that
[6/12/17, 9:21:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Well thats why people dont like KD, but isolate that out, and he deserves it
[6/12/17, 9:30:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: lol isolate that and he deserve it? Then that's pretending
[6/12/17, 9:30:44 PM] Cameron Freeman: But okay
[6/12/17, 9:30:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: We won't see eye to eye

[6/20/17, 5:36:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: Soccer is fun too me. Crossbar challenge is not fun to me.
[6/20/17, 5:37:29 PM] Dev Naik: Like an actually game or just messing around with a ball
[6/20/17, 5:38:52 PM] Cameron Freeman: Actual game

[6/20/17, 5:39:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: @ethan
[6/20/17, 5:39:56 PM] Dev Naik: We always go for free kick challenges
[6/20/17, 5:40:13 PM] Dev Naik: Range shots, different shots, crosses, finishes
[6/20/17, 5:40:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's like throwing a basketball and trying to hit the rim from half court

[6/20/17, 5:40:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: I'm just a type of guy who likes action an who was to play games instead of like "drill" like stuff y know
[6/20/17, 5:40:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im not insulting, im stating the truth. Its like why I dont want to play NHL games, its because im not good
[6/20/17, 5:41:18 PM] Dev Naik: We never have enough for a soccer game anyway
[6/20/17, 5:41:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You haven't felt real danger until you're standing in the goal post with dev about to hit you after you lost crossbar challenge

[6/23/17, 11:39:14 AM] Cameron Freeman: About what
[6/23/17, 11:39:21 AM] John Dong: Aye guys sorry but who going to the fair today?

[6/23/17, 11:39:45 AM] Cameron Freeman: Ale
[6/23/17, 11:39:47 AM] Cameron Freeman: Reyna
[6/23/17, 11:44:04 AM] Cameron Freeman: Dev? About what?
[6/23/17, 11:44:49 AM] Dev Naik: Pacifica being close to the city lol
[6/23/17, 11:45:03 AM] Dev Naik: He wanted something that felt farther away Idk lol
[6/23/17, 11:45:10 AM] Cameron Freeman: Sausalito is right next to the city
[6/23/17, 11:45:17 AM] Cameron Freeman: Pacifica is under Daly City
[6/23/17, 11:45:36 AM] Cameron Freeman: U can see the city from Sausalito lol wtf
[6/23/17, 11:45:43 AM] Dev Naik: It doesn't matter lol
[6/23/17, 11:45:50 AM] Dev Naik: Ya I know that
[6/23/17, 11:46:05 AM] Dev Naik: But it feels farther because you can see it across the bay you feel?
[6/23/17, 11:46:33 AM] Cameron Freeman: No lol I don't feel
[6/23/17, 11:47:43 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Sausalito seems a lot closer that makes no sense
[6/23/17, 11:47:56 AM] Cameron Freeman: Lol thank u Mohit I thought I was trippin
[6/23/17, 11:48:03 AM] Dev Naik: Lmao never mind

[6/23/17, 11:48:58 AM] Cameron Freeman: See how not close Pacifica is compared to Sausalito?
[6/23/17, 11:49:10 AM] John Dong: Guys let's just go to Pacifica cause Cameron's invited everyone and planned it so let's just  go there and it seems fun.
[6/23/17, 11:49:25 AM] Dev Naik: The only reason I said Sausalito is because it's closer to airport girl to come
[6/23/17, 11:49:44 AM] Cameron Freeman: Hu?
[6/23/17, 11:49:54 AM] Cameron Freeman: Airport is closer to Pacifica 😂😅
[6/23/17, 11:49:58 AM] Dev Naik: Lol nvm bro
[6/23/17, 11:50:03 AM] Cameron Freeman: Airport is in millbrae
[6/23/17, 11:50:15 AM] Dev Naik: The girl I met at the airport lived in San Rafael
[6/23/17, 11:50:20 AM] Dev Naik: Lives*
[6/23/17, 11:50:26 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I thought it was Santa Rosa?
[6/23/17, 11:50:32 AM] Cameron Freeman: OH AIRPORT GIRL
[6/23/17, 11:50:38 AM] Dev Naik: That's what I meant Mohit

[6/23/17, 11:50:50 AM] Cameron Freeman: Instead of making up shit hahahaha
[6/23/17, 11:51:22 AM] Dev Naik: lol although Dustin did say that he wanted to go somewhere not by the city and I for some reason used that as an excuse
[6/23/17, 11:51:33 AM] Dev Naik: Because it's weird over a group message lol
[6/23/17, 11:51:33 AM] Cameron Freeman: Lol bad excuse

[6/23/17, 11:52:43 AM] Cameron Freeman: And half moon bay is even farther 🤔ur stories aren't adding up Dev lol
[6/23/17, 11:53:10 AM] Dev Naik: I agree with John and I do think Pacifica will be great but Sausalito is closer to her so it gives her more of a reason to come
[6/23/17, 11:53:18 AM] Dev Naik: Also Dustin actually said half moon bay
[6/23/17, 11:53:24 AM] Dev Naik: That's was him

[6/23/17, 11:55:03 AM] Cameron Freeman: Changing location for one person is kinda Xtreme don't u think?🤔😂
[6/23/17, 11:56:08 AM] Dev Naik: Bruh nvm lol, it was just an option to go there because I didn't know Pacifica was set in stone
[6/23/17, 11:56:32 AM] Cameron Freeman: I think something happen to u in pacifica and u don't want to admit it

[6/23/17, 4:36:46 PM] Dev Naik: I was going to the fair because we all were...
[6/23/17, 4:37:30 PM] Dev Naik: I'd rather not spend $12 to walk around tbh if not all or a lot of us are going
[6/23/17, 4:37:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: The fair is the same every year? Is chillin doing nothing not the same every time we hang?
[6/23/17, 4:37:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: Smh
[6/23/17, 4:37:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: U guys are ridiculous
[6/23/17, 4:38:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dunno, we could go hang out at fallon or bernal
[6/23/17, 4:38:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Cam, that is a shit argument

[6/23/17, 4:40:07 PM] Dev Naik: True
[6/23/17, 4:40:15 PM] Dev Naik: TRUE
[6/23/17, 4:40:25 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: But the fair costs $$$
[6/23/17, 4:40:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Cam, you guys can go thats fine. We arent saying you dont have to, we just would prefer not
[6/23/17, 4:40:28 PM] Chase Larsen: I agree Timmy
[6/23/17, 4:40:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: No shit I can still go
[6/23/17, 4:40:41 PM] Cameron Freeman: But we all agreed we were
[6/23/17, 4:40:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: That was like part of the reason why we were going
[6/23/17, 4:40:51 PM] Dustin Bradley: Let's go to Fallon
[6/23/17, 4:41:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: They came here. To go. With everyone. And now ur all bailing.
[6/23/17, 4:41:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: Do u not see that ?
[6/23/17, 4:41:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes it costs money. Money that we all already agreed to spend.
[6/23/17, 4:41:40 PM] Dev Naik: The reason I was going to the fair was with everyone, but if no one wants to go I'd rather just spend time with them outside of the fair
[6/23/17, 4:41:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Again, I was only going for maddie whether I made that clear or not

[6/27/17, 11:29:56 PM] Chase Larsen: I formed an opinion based on the style of the previous movies
[6/27/17, 11:30:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The choice of not watching is an opinion
[6/27/17, 11:30:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Chase are you going to Pacifica on the 4th?
[6/27/17, 11:31:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ethan ur an idiot

[6/27/17, 11:32:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I may minor
[6/27/17, 11:33:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Psh. Like minors even matter. Come on ethan. If you aren't at Sfsu grad school yet. Do your majors even matter?
[6/27/17, 11:34:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Dawg why do I even go to shorty sjsu. I should transfer to a more prestigious school like sfsu
[6/27/17, 11:35:26 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ethan let's pack our bags and move
[6/27/17, 11:35:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I dont think we can even go to sfsu, it has too high standards
[6/27/17, 11:37:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I mean, sjsu is only 6th in public schools so like its retarded
[6/27/17, 11:37:28 PM] Joe Stine: Not even top 5
[6/27/17, 11:37:44 PM] Dev Naik: Who the fuck cares...

[6/27/17, 11:42:00 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Although on the subject, Dev some schools are better than other. A degree from ITT tech is not the same as a degree from UC or CSU
[6/27/17, 11:42:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And sfsu degrees are better than sjsu degrees
[6/27/17, 11:42:28 PM] Dev Naik: Bruh I don't give a shit about what school someone goes to

[6/27/17, 11:43:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Tell that to the BAR association
[6/27/17, 11:43:35 PM] Dev Naik: The quality of a person matters more
[6/27/17, 11:43:55 PM] Owen Gilbert: I liked the movie
[6/27/17, 11:44:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Also tell that to med school
[6/27/17, 11:44:52 PM] Dev Naik: Not everything is about how smart you are educationally. Sure it matters, and it's important but there is so much more to life
[6/27/17, 11:44:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The quality of the person matters like crazy. But at the same time, we live in a "corrupt" world
[6/27/17, 11:44:56 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya that tell that to grad school, business school, Med school, law school etc etc

[6/27/17, 11:46:17 PM] Dev Naik: The system itself is fucked. We haven't changed the school system in a world that has been changing

[6/28/17, 11:18:49 AM] Cameron Freeman: He just did it cuz he didn't want to screw over the clippers

[6/28/17, 11:21:53 AM] Cameron Freeman: The cavs tryna trade away Kevin love but no one wants him 😂
[6/28/17, 11:23:00 AM] Chase Larsen: Lol I don't know why Kevin love is a good player
[6/28/17, 11:23:09 AM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah
[6/28/17, 11:23:13 AM] Chase Larsen: Also his uncle is one of the founding members of the beach boys
[6/28/17, 11:23:18 AM] Chase Larsen: So that's a huge plus
[6/28/17, 11:25:04 AM] Joe Stine: It's cause love can't play in the post.
[6/28/17, 11:25:33 AM] Joe Stine: It's pretty much the same thing as aldridge. Both soft in the post and don't play hard defense to make up for it.
[6/28/17, 11:57:27 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Cameron I just watched Owens vlog. You hella like Collie Buddz now huh haha

[7/3/17, 4:46:02 PM] Dustin Bradley: Sooooo 🖕🏻
[7/3/17, 4:57:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Fact?
[7/3/17, 4:57:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Where are your sources
[7/3/17, 4:58:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He is his own source. He is Ape.
[7/3/17, 4:59:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Hearsay
[7/3/17, 4:59:45 PM] Dustin Bradley: Extactly I'm my own facts
[7/3/17, 5:00:32 PM] Dustin Bradley: I am the source of all things ape
[7/3/17, 5:02:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Actually no, that's a lie. I created Ape the Series. So technically.
[7/3/17, 5:02:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah
[7/3/17, 5:06:18 PM] Dustin Bradley: Mohit who's the Ape u or me (ME) so technically since I'm the minority in this group that makes me alpha Ape sooo don't fuck with Thee Alpha this is my Domain biotch!!!!
[7/3/17, 5:06:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Shut up
[7/3/17, 5:07:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin, that's the most dumb logic.
[7/3/17, 5:07:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: "I'm the minority...that makes me alpha"
[7/3/17, 5:07:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: MEET AT LINDA MAR @11 it's the beach with a Taco Bell on it so Mohit be a little busy but I'll go searching for something better if we don't like it but it's super nice!
[7/3/17, 5:07:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thanks cam
[7/3/17, 5:07:50 PM] Dustin Bradley: It's my ape logic
[7/3/17, 5:07:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait be a little busy?
[7/3/17, 5:08:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I'm confused
[7/3/17, 5:08:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The beach i think

[7/9/17, 10:15:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: There we go
[7/9/17, 10:15:47 PM] Chase Larsen: Dude don't forget if Harry Giles on te Kings can stay healthy he will be great too. He was the number one high school player
[7/9/17, 10:17:09 PM] Chase Larsen: And Tatum is insane, he actually reminds me of Demarcus cousins in that he will score 24-30 a game
[7/9/17, 10:17:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh shit true
[7/9/17, 10:17:23 PM] Chase Larsen: Doesn't matter if he isn't shooting well he will
Still find a way
[7/9/17, 10:17:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Markelle fultz or whatever? He's good but ankle fucked up now
[7/9/17, 10:17:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And Tatum is fucking wild dude. That step back is changing lives like damn haha
[7/9/17, 10:18:41 PM] Chase Larsen: Fultz will be good but I would say the most NBA ready are fox Tatum and Jackson
[7/9/17, 10:18:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya
[7/9/17, 10:19:00 PM] Chase Larsen: Not saying the others won't be good they just need a little more time to develop
[7/9/17, 10:19:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And fox is pretty much getting mentored by Vince chatter
[7/9/17, 10:19:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Carter
[7/9/17, 10:19:15 PM] Chase Larsen: And George hill
[7/9/17, 10:19:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And nah I feel you. They need more time to understand the more aggressive NBA compared to college ball
[7/9/17, 10:19:46 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah exactly
[7/9/17, 10:19:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I'm just glad Tatum got to a team that's kinda set up and has a good coach
[7/9/17, 10:20:08 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah he will fit in really well
[7/9/17, 10:20:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or else he'd turn out like jahlil okafor
[7/9/17, 10:20:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Who was DESTROYING at duke but now he's just aight
[7/9/17, 10:20:32 PM] Chase Larsen: Exactly, what's okafor even doing now haha
[7/9/17, 10:21:17 PM] Chase Larsen: Embiid is actually really good, he just can't stay healthy. He is worse than Derrick rose
[7/9/17, 10:21:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I can see that
[7/9/17, 10:21:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And ya he's not doing too much. He's in philly
[7/9/17, 10:22:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The sixers don't know what to do with him

[7/20/17, 12:06:58 PM] Dev Naik: He can still get a job
[7/20/17, 12:07:13 PM] Dev Naik: By all means it wouldn't be a great job but he probably still could
[7/20/17, 12:07:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: Who's gana hire him
[7/20/17, 12:07:20 PM] Dev Naik: Plus it's OJ Simpson
[7/20/17, 12:07:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: U know how many people hate him
[7/20/17, 12:07:34 PM] Dev Naik: Guaranteed someone will hire him
[7/20/17, 12:07:45 PM] Dev Naik: You know how many people still like him?
[7/20/17, 12:08:45 PM] Dev Naik: Plus maybe he won't get a job, possibly join some organization with the NFL fighting against crime and violence or something idk
[7/20/17, 12:11:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its the same problem for all felons. Plus he is 70
[7/20/17, 12:11:25 PM] Chase Larsen: I don't know man maybe ESPN will do some story with him but I don't know if roger goodell and the NFL will want to be involved with him that much
[7/20/17, 12:11:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He probably still has connections though so he's gunna find something.
[7/20/17, 12:12:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He is 70. I dont think he needs a job
[7/20/17, 12:12:30 PM] Jonathan Ong: Lol never gonna happen.. people with records like him never find a job if they get out. And he should've served a life sentence for what he did all those years ago
[7/20/17, 12:12:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[7/20/17, 12:12:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What are you talking about Jon. He never did anything.
[7/20/17, 12:12:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If the glove don't fit
[7/20/17, 12:13:23 PM] Jonathan Ong: Oh maaaa gaawd staaap
[7/20/17, 12:13:28 PM] Dev Naik: Lol he is 70
[7/20/17, 12:13:41 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol he definitely was guilty
[7/20/17, 12:14:00 PM] Dev Naik: And he would find a job, most people do with records
[7/20/17, 12:14:11 PM] Dev Naik: It just wouldn't be a great job
[7/20/17, 12:15:13 PM] Dev Naik: Not guilty chase
[7/20/17, 12:15:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He wasn't guilty
[7/20/17, 12:15:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats the point of the courts
[7/20/17, 12:16:07 PM] Dev Naik: Yups
[7/20/17, 12:17:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Sorry my bad he wasn't found guilty
[7/20/17, 12:17:22 PM] Jonathan Ong: Sometimes the courts are wrong. Just look at the number of innocent people the justice system has incarcerated throughout the years
[7/20/17, 12:17:47 PM] Chase Larsen: But he definitely did it God knows
[7/20/17, 12:17:51 PM] Dev Naik: That was almost OJ
[7/20/17, 12:18:06 PM] Dev Naik: And how would you know he did Chase?
[7/20/17, 12:18:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Regardless, you werent there and the courts decided
[7/20/17, 12:18:18 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly
[7/20/17, 12:19:04 PM] Chase Larsen: It doesn't matter he was found guilty for other crimes he is a criminal now
[7/20/17, 12:19:15 PM] Chase Larsen: He had a lot of chances to fix himself and he didn't
[7/20/17, 12:19:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He was found guilty of robbery
[7/20/17, 12:19:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats the point of parole
[7/20/17, 12:19:33 PM] Dev Naik: Lol
[7/20/17, 12:19:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: To release prisoners who have changed
[7/20/17, 12:20:28 PM] Dev Naik: Otherwise he wouldn't have been accepted for parole
[7/20/17, 12:20:32 PM] Jonathan Ong: Still a criminal and always will be.. I would have shipped him off to my cousin Kim Jong un to work in his labor camps
[7/20/17, 12:21:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Too bad Kim Jong Un wasn't the leader back then
[7/20/17, 12:21:28 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol I get that Ethan I'm all
For giving people chances but you can't say he didn't commit those crimes
[7/20/17, 12:21:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He committed robbery
[7/20/17, 12:21:46 PM] Dev Naik: Sure he is a criminal for being involved in a robbery, where he was blinded by others to think all of his stuff was stolen first
[7/20/17, 12:21:52 PM] Chase Larsen: Ok that's a crime is it not?
[7/20/17, 12:21:55 PM] Jonathan Ong: Well now he is
[7/20/17, 12:22:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im not saying he isnt a criminal
[7/20/17, 12:22:35 PM] Chase Larsen: Ok and I was fair with saying he wasn't found guilty are we all good? Hahah
[7/20/17, 12:22:45 PM] Dev Naik: Have you ever gotten a ticket? Or even sped for that matter?
[7/20/17, 12:23:02 PM] Jonathan Ong: Parole is dumb. I don't care how much people change they serve the time they are sentenced to for whatever crime they committed in the first place
[7/20/17, 12:23:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol I was jus saying he wasnt going to look for a job because he doesnt need to
[7/20/17, 12:23:12 PM] Chase Larsen: Me personally I have never been pulled over Dev
[7/20/17, 12:23:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He served his crime Jon
[7/20/17, 12:23:18 PM] Chase Larsen: Knock on wood
[7/20/17, 12:23:20 PM] Dev Naik: But have you sped?
[7/20/17, 12:23:42 PM] Dev Naik: The minimum was 9 years of which he served
[7/20/17, 12:24:17 PM] Chase Larsen: Not to a dangerous speed but it doesn't Thayer cause you can't compare speeding to theft
[7/20/17, 12:24:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Matter*
[7/20/17, 12:24:41 PM] Dev Naik: But it's still breaking the law so technically you are a criminal
[7/20/17, 12:25:08 PM] Dev Naik: Maybe not to the extreme of theft but it's still a crime
[7/20/17, 12:25:21 PM] Chase Larsen: No I'm not because I was never found guilty of anything and there are no records of me speeding
[7/20/17, 12:25:53 PM] Dev Naik: Ok so if someone kills someone and doesn't get caught they aren't a criminal?
[7/20/17, 12:26:01 PM] Chase Larsen: And I was fair and corrected myself with saying he wasn't guilty
[7/20/17, 12:26:15 PM] Dev Naik: Hahaha I'm pulling your leg
[7/20/17, 12:26:47 PM] Chase Larsen: Innocent until
Proven guilty
[7/20/17, 12:26:51 PM] Dev Naik: But you should be shipped to Jon's cousin because that's where every criminal should go
[7/20/17, 12:27:04 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol true
[7/20/17, 12:27:06 PM] Dev Naik: Fair but I am a witness in your car when you were speeding
[7/20/17, 12:27:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait if you are a witness and don't report the crime doesn't that make you an accomplice?
[7/20/17, 12:27:34 PM] Chase Larsen: But your not gonna go to the police about it hahahah
[7/20/17, 12:27:39 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol
[7/20/17, 12:27:44 PM] Chase Larsen: Mohit haha
[7/20/17, 12:27:46 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Mohit we all are criminals
[7/20/17, 12:28:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Who is the most criminal out of this whole group
[7/20/17, 12:28:09 PM] Dev Naik: We should all be in a labor camp according to Jon lmao
[7/20/17, 12:28:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yes
[7/20/17, 12:28:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: No parole
[7/20/17, 12:28:32 PM] Dev Naik: Nope..
[7/20/17, 12:28:40 PM] Chase Larsen: The most criminal?
[7/20/17, 12:28:45 PM] Chase Larsen: Hmmmm

[7/21/17, 12:49:39 PM] Chase Larsen: Where did you see that?
[7/21/17, 12:49:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: God damn
[7/21/17, 12:49:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya where did you see that I can't find it.
[7/21/17, 12:49:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: Relax
‎[7/21/17, 12:50:18 PM] Cameron Freeman: ‎image omitted
[7/21/17, 12:51:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Where can he go and be a bigger role and be in a team that actually can make it to the finals
[7/21/17, 12:52:27 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: He should go to the Warriors
[7/21/17, 12:55:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: 🐍?
[7/21/17, 1:18:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lebron to lakers
[7/21/17, 1:18:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kyrie to brooklyn
[7/21/17, 1:18:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lebron and Kirie to Celtics
[7/21/17, 1:19:13 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lies
[7/21/17, 1:19:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kyrie wants away from lebron
[7/21/17, 1:19:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Brooklyn has all supporting cast players
[7/21/17, 1:19:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lebron to Brooklyn. Kirie to celtics
[7/21/17, 1:20:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lebron to celts
[7/21/17, 1:20:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kyrie to nets
[7/21/17, 1:20:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah we don't want him
[7/21/17, 1:20:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: All supporting cast? Are you guys even a team still?
[7/21/17, 1:29:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: The cavs are about to sign derick rose
[7/21/17, 1:29:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: It wouldn't be too crazy for Kyrie to go to nets or lakers because he wants to be the main guy and they have no one really
[7/21/17, 1:30:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Wow I'm like no way derick rose is going to the cavs but now it makes sence
[7/21/17, 1:30:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don't think he'd go to the lakers tho would he? I thought lakers were trying to start off with a completely new fresh team.
[7/21/17, 1:30:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like rookies
[7/21/17, 1:30:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: No not completely new
[7/21/17, 1:30:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And build off from there
[7/21/17, 1:30:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Gotchu
[7/21/17, 1:30:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: The lakers need and want a vet like that
[7/21/17, 1:30:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: They need someone to guide lonzo
[7/21/17, 1:30:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[7/21/17, 1:30:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: Especially someone with championship and playoff experience to carry them
[7/21/17, 1:31:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lakers and nets seem like the two bedt places
[7/21/17, 1:31:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exactly
[7/21/17, 1:32:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Nets have russell and mosgov and the second year guy, but I cant remember his fucking name. I think that is a good, young three to put around a vet
[7/21/17, 1:32:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Hollis jefferson
[7/21/17, 1:32:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Plus nets have made almost zero moves so far
[7/21/17, 1:32:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But at the same time, would Kyrie want to go to a completely rookie driven team of the lakers. I'm assuming he wants to lead a team but he also wants people that have some experience in the league
[7/21/17, 1:33:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That's true ethan
[7/21/17, 1:33:09 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And eastern conference
[7/21/17, 1:33:17 PM] Cameron Freeman: Idk I think kyrie wants exaclty that
[7/21/17, 1:33:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But that's like another 2-3-4 years until they have that perfect cohesiveness. And he doesn't know when his prime ends
[7/21/17, 1:33:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because then it will forsure be his team
[7/21/17, 1:33:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think the conference is what will make the difference in the end. No one wants to play in a growing team in the west rn
[7/21/17, 1:34:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: But he already has rings
[7/21/17, 1:34:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: He wants to be the face and get money
[7/21/17, 1:34:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That's true
[7/21/17, 1:34:32 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He just has the one right?
[7/21/17, 1:34:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I think it's just 1.
[7/21/17, 1:35:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The one when the warriors lost the 3-1 lead
[7/21/17, 1:35:33 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right
[7/21/17, 1:37:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: I feel like he has two
‎[7/21/17, 1:38:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ‎image omitted
[7/21/17, 1:38:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The bottom
[7/21/17, 1:38:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He has 1
[7/21/17, 1:38:59 PM] Chase Larsen: He should go to the Kings
[7/21/17, 1:40:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: Oh okay forsure
[7/21/17, 2:24:31 PM] Joe Stine: He should go to the wolves. Butler, wiggins, towns and kyrie
[7/21/17, 2:25:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Super team?
[7/21/17, 2:25:37 PM] Joe Stine: Not now but eventually they would be.
[7/21/17, 2:26:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Holy shit that would be a crazy team
[7/21/17, 2:27:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But then again. He wouldn't have control over the team. Butler and him would clash I feel
‎[7/21/17, 2:28:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ‎image omitted
[7/21/17, 2:29:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I stand corrected
[7/21/17, 2:43:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: That doesn't make any sence
[7/21/17, 2:44:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: Miami and new York does I guess
[7/21/17, 2:44:07 PM] Cameron Freeman: But he won't be the star in San Antonio
[7/21/17, 2:50:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I feel like it's because Leonard is a superstar talent but he's not someone that has that crazy personality and is very outspoken about leading the team.
[7/21/17, 2:50:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don't think he is at least. I might be wrong
[7/21/17, 3:11:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: Idk I'm so shook
[7/21/17, 3:12:20 PM] Chris Cheng: Bro Minnesota!!
[7/21/17, 3:12:26 PM] Chris Cheng: That would be great to watch

[8/7/17, 7:38:21 AM] Owen Gilbert: Fun facts from odog, gangnam style was not only passed up from most viewed video on YouTube, it's now in 3rd place with 2.9 billion. At just over 3 billion is see you again from wiz, and now number one at 3 billion and 60 million is the original despacito
[8/7/17, 7:44:00 AM] Owen Gilbert: 3 billion fucking views in only 6 months
[8/7/17, 9:54:13 AM] Chase Larsen: That's ridiculous I could name you so many better songs that deserve more views

[8/7/17, 10:10:42 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I completed all the challenges and then deleted the app. And I guess it restarted.
[8/7/17, 10:10:57 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I already got all the different balls
[8/7/17, 10:16:32 AM] Dev Naik: Fosho
[8/7/17, 11:46:29 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Damn I didnt even realize the popularity of the songs
[8/7/17, 11:46:58 AM] Cameron Freeman: Idk Chase it's pretty fucking good
[8/7/17, 11:50:13 AM] Owen Gilbert: Ehhhhh debatable lol
[8/7/17, 11:50:19 AM] Chase Larsen: I'm sorry queen, Rolling Stones, Beatles, strokes, RHCP, the killers, ACDC, and the police have songs that are so much better. And that's just a couple of groups
[8/7/17, 11:50:32 AM] Cameron Freeman: That's your opinion
[8/7/17, 11:50:35 AM] Chase Larsen: I didn't even name any swing, jazz, or classical
[8/7/17, 11:50:38 AM] Owen Gilbert: The entire song is just about sex
[8/7/17, 11:50:51 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Your opinion too cam
[8/7/17, 11:50:53 AM] Cameron Freeman: Just because u do not like Spanish music doesn't make it not good
[8/7/17, 11:51:07 AM] Mohit Veligenti: He didn't say not good though.
[8/7/17, 11:51:07 AM] Chase Larsen: Dude I love Spanish music are you kidding me
[8/7/17, 11:51:15 AM] Mohit Veligenti: He said better than
[8/7/17, 11:51:16 AM] Cameron Freeman: Yes. Yes it is.
[8/7/17, 11:51:21 AM] Chase Larsen: I just saw a violin and guitar classical duo
[8/7/17, 11:51:31 AM] Chase Larsen: That did all tango and Spanish composers
[8/7/17, 11:51:33 AM] Cameron Freeman: It's obviously a fact too based on the views.............
[8/7/17, 11:51:40 AM] Dev Naik: Yoo the original despacito is great
[8/7/17, 11:52:02 AM] Cameron Freeman: RT
[8/7/17, 11:52:03 AM] Chase Larsen: And yes I said that these are better in my opinion
[8/7/17, 11:52:14 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeah the non Beiber version is actually really good
[8/7/17, 11:52:18 AM] Owen Gilbert: Better deserving of 3 billion views
[8/7/17, 11:52:30 AM] Owen Gilbert: Other songs
[8/7/17, 11:52:34 AM] Dev Naik: That's cool! Everyone has their own music taste and that's chill
[8/7/17, 11:52:46 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo let's be honest though. Chief Keef deserves 10 billion views for all his music.
[8/7/17, 11:52:53 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Idk actually. Despacito is a spanish song, and it got popularity in the US. Its gonna hit 3 bil
[8/7/17, 11:53:25 AM] Chase Larsen: Dev I'm fine with people having different opinions it's just I dorm understand how that would have more views than let's say don't stop me now by queen
[8/7/17, 11:53:27 AM] Dev Naik: The only reason it has 3 billion views is because the OG has been out for soooo long, also Biebs made it popular and he has a wide range of fans

[8/22/17, 5:13:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He is going to the Cavs, its not like he is getting a downgrade
[8/22/17, 5:13:41 PM] Chase Larsen: I know but still to have all these teams not want you, that's rough
[8/22/17, 5:25:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Cavs also got Crowder and the Nets 1st rounder next year so basically lottery

[8/26/17, 9:56:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He doesn't know how to hold his ground.

[8/26/17, 9:57:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Nah its not respectable but not cheating
[8/26/17, 9:57:54 PM] Dev Naik: Ya but it's technically against the rules

[8/26/17, 9:58:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No it isnt
[8/26/17, 9:58:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It is within the rules
[8/26/17, 9:58:08 PM] Dev Naik: Which is why the ref broke it up every time
[8/26/17, 9:58:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: He kept cheating.
[8/26/17, 9:58:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No he broke it up because when they hold each other it isnt safe
[8/26/17, 9:58:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya.

[8/26/17, 9:58:40 PM] Dev Naik: You can't really dip your head the entire time though
[8/26/17, 9:58:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It's not cheating to put your head down.
[8/26/17, 9:58:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Sure you can
[8/26/17, 9:59:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Mcgregor did hammer fists, that was against the rules
[8/26/17, 9:59:05 PM] Dev Naik: I guess
[8/26/17, 9:59:10 PM] Dev Naik: Which was annoying
[8/26/17, 9:59:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Mayweather turning his back was against the rules though.
[8/26/17, 9:59:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: I'm saying every time he'd try to grind on may weather
[8/26/17, 9:59:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Mayweather just plays defensively, and he is just not a respectable fighter
[8/26/17, 9:59:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: He's grab him from behind and hump him
[8/26/17, 9:59:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What else could he do

[8/26/17, 10:00:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Turning around is not against the rules
[8/26/17, 10:00:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: I'm talking about Connor humping may weather

[8/26/17, 10:01:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So you can't dip your head so low it's below your opponents belt
[8/26/17, 10:02:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And mayweather was like borderline but he never went that low
[8/26/17, 10:02:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right

[8/26/17, 10:16:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right, but its not dirty or unfair its just doesnt make him respectable
[8/26/17, 10:22:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Technacly may weather is 51-0 if you count his wife

[9/3/17, 11:20:04 PM] Chase Larsen: Why? Like I know we never really made up but that's because everyone moved on. All of his videos and texts were him saying sorry but we weren't good friends
[9/3/17, 11:20:35 PM] Chase Larsen: I just brought it up because we were talking about old times and nobody had the videos
[9/3/17, 11:21:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya true. Chris why do you feel bad?
[9/3/17, 11:22:13 PM] Chris Cheng: Idk. I just feel sorry for him now

[9/3/17, 11:22:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean. He fucked up. And he had to deal with his consequences. It's not like we kicked him out of the group for nothing like he did cameron in freshman year.

[9/3/17, 11:24:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: For good reason though.
[9/3/17, 11:24:27 PM] Chris Cheng: I guess so
[9/3/17, 11:24:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Bringing it back up owen?
[9/3/17, 11:24:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean we are I guess. But I guess it's more so for like damn this is hilarious rather than the reasons he does it for.

[9/27/17, 7:07:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dude I hella like it nice. Where'd you get it?
[9/27/17, 7:07:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hold up

[9/27/17, 7:08:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Why does that shit look fake as fuck in that picture
[9/27/17, 7:08:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya dustin imma need another pic. I kinda don't believe it
[9/27/17, 7:18:09 PM] Owen Gilbert: Woah woah woah, Dustin? With that big and dope of tattoo? Need some proof if you say it's real haha. Looks sweet though man
[9/27/17, 7:18:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It looks hella dope
[9/27/17, 7:18:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But his arm is super white in that pic
[9/27/17, 7:18:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Compared to everything else

[9/27/17, 7:49:21 PM] Dustin Bradley: Though*
[9/27/17, 7:50:13 PM] Owen Gilbert: Wooooow not even a fake tattoo? Just an app lol
[9/27/17, 8:00:56 PM] Dev Naik: Not gonna lie I think it's kinda random... why would you get an owl anyway??
[9/27/17, 8:01:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I hate you dustin
[9/27/17, 8:01:45 PM] Dev Naik: It's cool I guess but idk feel like it's not that cool
[9/27/17, 8:01:59 PM] Dev Naik: Unless there's a meaning lol
[9/27/17, 8:18:38 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I'm so relived it's random cause I was about to say I

[9/27/17, 10:00:06 PM] Dustin Bradley: Crap 💩
[9/27/17, 10:04:21 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: 😂😂😂
[9/27/17, 10:48:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Tbh I was gonna roast dat ass if that was real
[9/27/17, 10:49:37 PM] Dustin Bradley: Man Fock you
[9/27/17, 10:49:40 PM] Dustin Bradley: Haha jk
[9/28/17, 9:27:43 AM] Owen Gilbert: Gopro, along with the hero 6, also released a 360 camera this morning, fucking $800 tho
[9/28/17, 9:29:39 AM] Owen Gilbert: Well 700, but still expensive af
[9/28/17, 10:06:02 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Is this why Gopro's stock only worth 10$?
[9/28/17, 10:07:29 AM] Owen Gilbert: Well being one of the biggest companies camera companies in the world, but only selling one product a year, they have to think of something lol
[9/28/17, 10:09:37 AM] Owen Gilbert: Only up until last year when they released their drone, which was recalled because the batteries disconnected and fell out of the skies lol, they have only sold one camera a year
[9/28/17, 10:10:34 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: GoPro is not even close to being the biggest camera company in the world
[9/28/17, 10:11:00 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cannon, Sony, Olympus, Nikon
[9/28/17, 10:11:20 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I think he means like quantity wise tim which isn't wrong
[9/28/17, 10:11:25 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Everyone has a GoPro
[9/28/17, 10:12:15 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's not true
[9/28/17, 10:12:21 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Show me the numbers
[9/28/17, 10:13:07 AM] Dev Naik: I don't have a go pro..
[9/28/17, 10:13:47 AM] Mohit Veligenti: True. I don't have numbers lol
[9/28/17, 10:14:14 AM] Owen Gilbert: Well god damn tim I was just saying that they sell one product a year and they're a billion dollar company lol
[9/28/17, 10:15:04 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I never said your wrong. I just disagree that they are one of the biggest company's in the world
[9/28/17, 10:15:26 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Your right they do make 1 product a year and they don't target the average camera consumer.
‎[9/28/17, 10:17:08 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: ‎image omitted
[9/28/17, 10:17:08 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: In a span of a year
[9/28/17, 10:17:55 AM] Owen Gilbert: Cause they make one product lol
[9/28/17, 10:18:50 AM] Owen Gilbert: That's why they made the 360 camera and the karma drone. To branch off to different categories instead of just an action camera
[9/28/17, 10:19:07 AM] Owen Gilbert: Cause they are going down, a lot
[9/28/17, 10:19:27 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Tbh I see more people with gopros then actual cameras
[9/28/17, 10:19:32 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Than*
[9/28/17, 10:21:00 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I don't. That's a subjective view though
[9/28/17, 10:21:25 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: You are right. It is.
[9/28/17, 10:23:38 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I just don't get the hype about GoPro
[9/28/17, 10:24:43 AM] Owen Gilbert: 4k 60fps, 1080p 240 fps, in a very tiny form factor, at a reasonable price
[9/28/17, 10:24:55 AM] Owen Gilbert: Good 4k too
[9/28/17, 10:25:06 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its targeted towards athletes and hikers basically
[9/28/17, 10:25:32 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: The size and ability to "go" with you is the selling point
[9/28/17, 10:27:14 AM] Chase Larsen: I feel like it's sold to like Ethan said hikers, and athletes, and that's why they aren't doing as well. They have one group with like Owen said one product
[9/28/17, 10:27:40 AM] Chase Larsen: They probably can't expand as much as other camera companies could
[9/28/17, 2:45:26 PM] Owen Gilbert: If anyone wants the new gopro, I get $106 off of it lol
[9/28/17, 3:36:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: How much would it be
[9/28/17, 3:38:03 PM] Owen Gilbert: It's 499, I get it for 393
[9/28/17, 3:41:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ahhhh
[9/28/17, 3:47:10 PM] Dev Naik: Damn
[9/29/17, 12:21:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Holy russ...$205 mil?
[9/29/17, 12:24:32 PM] Dev Naik: Ya that's ridiculous!!
‎[9/29/17, 3:35:40 PM] Owen Gilbert: ‎image omitted
[9/29/17, 3:36:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just charging?
[9/29/17, 3:36:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats it?
[9/29/17, 3:36:40 PM] Owen Gilbert: Yup, just chillin on the charger for a few minutes  and *pop*
[9/29/17, 3:37:36 PM] Owen Gilbert: But before you guys say it's only 2 out of the plenty sold, there were only 20 reports of the note 7 exploding, and that shut down the entire production
[9/29/17, 3:38:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Well popping is different than exploding
[9/29/17, 3:38:25 PM] Owen Gilbert: True, I'm just saying it for the numbers sake
[9/29/17, 3:39:41 PM] Owen Gilbert: And actually the second phone was already split in the box when it was opened
[9/29/17, 3:39:49 PM] Owen Gilbert: #splitgate
[9/29/17, 3:39:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Apple gang
[9/29/17, 3:40:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: One bad apple doesnt spoil the bunch
[9/29/17, 3:40:09 PM] Dev Naik: GANG GANG
[9/29/17, 3:40:24 PM] Owen Gilbert: Numbers can rise, just sayin
[9/29/17, 3:40:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Id rather get a refund on my phone breaking than have to get surgery because it blew off my finger
[9/29/17, 3:41:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: Poop Gang
[9/29/17, 4:49:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: POOP GANG

[9/30/17, 7:17:03 PM] Dev Naik: Damn!
[10/1/17, 12:18:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: THE JUICE IS LOOSE
[10/1/17, 12:20:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Eyyyy
[10/1/17, 12:21:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Where that white bronco at?
[10/1/17, 12:28:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Juice man is outta prison finally. No idea where he is now
[10/1/17, 2:55:49 PM] Chase Larsen: Damn did you guys see the original Book of Mormon was just bought for 35 million
[10/1/17, 2:56:41 PM] Chase Larsen: The LDS church got donations from people to buy it from the community of Christ
[10/1/17, 3:02:01 PM] Chase Larsen: I think that makes it the highest paid manuscript/ book
[10/1/17, 3:02:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dang that's actually pretty cool
[10/1/17, 3:03:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: When you say LDS church is it like a central church that is the biggest one? Assuming it's in Utah
[10/1/17, 3:03:25 PM] Chase Larsen: It's interesting that the LDS church didn't have it
[10/1/17, 3:03:36 PM] Chase Larsen: LDS church just means all Mormons basically
[10/1/17, 3:03:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So in a way you also paid for that book?
[10/1/17, 3:03:52 PM] Chase Larsen: But where most of the leaders live is in Utah
[10/1/17, 3:03:56 PM] Chase Larsen: No
[10/1/17, 3:04:06 PM] Chase Larsen: They didn't use tithing
[10/1/17, 3:04:28 PM] Chase Larsen: There was some random rich Mormons who donated solely for this reason
[10/1/17, 3:04:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And tithing is like the yearly amount you give every year right? Sorry I'm asking a lot of questions. I don't remember the terms and all
[10/1/17, 3:05:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And ohh gotchu. So straight up donations
[10/1/17, 3:05:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dang they dropped 35 milli and just donated. That's crazy
[10/1/17, 3:05:32 PM] Chase Larsen: And the original manuscript was owned by the community of Christ which is basically People who left the Mormon church because they thought only Joseph smiths kids should be prophets
[10/1/17, 3:05:45 PM] Chase Larsen: And yes that's tithing
[10/1/17, 3:05:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Gotchu
[10/1/17, 3:06:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dang. That's good that its with the LDS church now.
[10/1/17, 3:06:50 PM] Chase Larsen: They are weirdos, the church doesn't call them Mormons. And they are the people that still do polygamy and other weird stuff ahhah
[10/1/17, 3:07:40 PM] Chase Larsen: Not all of them "the community of Christ is just a bunch of people doing different stuff
Hahah
[10/1/17, 3:09:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fosho fosho
[10/1/17, 4:31:47 PM] Chase Larsen: Hey joe I'm in Reno
[10/1/17, 4:33:17 PM] Joe Stine: You wanna stop by my house lmao?
[10/1/17, 4:33:43 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol I'm on arroyos steet
[10/1/17, 4:34:43 PM] Chase Larsen: Where are you at? Haha
[10/1/17, 4:35:42 PM] Joe Stine: Im like 4 miles away from there
[10/1/17, 4:36:02 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol I think I'm going to a place called burger me now
[10/1/17, 4:36:16 PM] Chase Larsen: Off the freeway
[10/1/17, 4:36:23 PM] Chase Larsen: Sorry Ethan
[10/2/17, 6:08:16 AM] Owen Gilbert: Holy fuck did you guys read what happened in vegas????
[10/2/17, 7:12:42 AM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah ☹️😔😔
[10/2/17, 7:36:40 AM] Bryce Olson: Yea 😢😞
[10/2/17, 8:03:47 AM] Dustin Bradley: Yea ☹️😔😞
[10/2/17, 9:21:50 AM] Chase Larsen: I just read what happened. That's so sad
[10/2/17, 9:28:52 AM] Dev Naik: I know...
[10/2/17, 11:36:56 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I was up last night following it
[10/2/17, 12:53:01 PM] Joe Stine: Chris are you good?
[10/2/17, 12:59:32 PM] Dustin Bradley: That 64 year old man was a normal citizen no criminal records  as far as we know and was with his brother very recently   killing almost 60 people and injured more than 500  this act of violence makes no sense I'm just dumbfounded by it
[10/2/17, 1:05:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: 64 yr old man. Isis claimed responsibility saying he converted to islam years ago (unconfirmed). Death toll up in the 70s. 10 rifles were found in the room he shot from. Killed himself before police arrived. They were looking for a 50's aged woman, but I havent followed what happened to that
[10/2/17, 1:12:16 PM] Dustin Bradley: I don't believe that because isis claimed they were responsible for the Orlando night club shooting and nothing was confirmed if it was true or not
[10/2/17, 1:12:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: i think isis likes taking credit for things
[10/2/17, 1:12:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Hence why i said unconfirmed
[10/2/17, 1:12:57 PM] Owen Gilbert: Isis like to claim evil shit
[10/2/17, 1:12:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: that aren't really them
[10/2/17, 1:13:10 PM] Owen Gilbert: ^
[10/2/17, 1:13:10 PM] Dustin Bradley: Sorry Ethan didn't see that
[10/2/17, 1:20:15 PM] Dustin Bradley: I just can't make any sense of it he wasn't mentally ill that we know of so far and suddenly single handedly  committed one of the largest mass murders in US History 🤔 is this going to be a normal thing now where it turns into a competition between wicked people to see how many masses of people they can kill?
[10/2/17, 1:20:45 PM] Dustin Bradley: Like honestly
[10/2/17, 1:21:04 PM] Owen Gilbert: His brother said he could have just bottled up emotions and just cracked
[10/2/17, 1:32:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin I don't think you've said a more true statement damn.
[10/2/17, 1:34:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Unfortunately mental illness is a mystery sometimes to even the people who have them, family couldn't have known if he didn't. In order to have the ability to kill someone, mental illness is going to be a factor
[10/2/17, 1:36:47 PM] Owen Gilbert: Mental illness or not, it's still terrorism. I hate that the news separates those 2 things
[10/2/17, 1:37:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Only seperated when they are white unfortunately
[10/2/17, 1:38:18 PM] Owen Gilbert: Again, still terrorism, no matter what race, religion, practice, anything, that kind of violence is still terrorism and he was a terrorist
[10/2/17, 1:40:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Not disagreeing
[10/2/17, 1:43:49 PM] Jonathan Ong: Totally agree Owen
[10/2/17, 1:46:10 PM] Dev Naik: What seems to happen in today's world, is that white people tend to not get acquainted with the label of a terrorist. I don't think anyone is disagreeing with you, it just sucks to see how bias things can be
[10/2/17, 1:50:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: White/Asian=mentally ill/drug abuser
Black/Hispanic=gangbanger/drug abuser
All else basically=terrorist
Muslim=ISIS
[10/2/17, 1:52:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: I think we can put terrorist and isis in same category
[10/2/17, 1:52:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It's because during the Bush Admin, terrorist was equated to a Muslim person. Muslim always preceded the word terrorist
[10/2/17, 1:52:35 PM] Jonathan Ong: Well the majority of cases of terrorism in the modern era are caused by radical islamists so it's not a surprise that ppl would think like that
[10/2/17, 1:52:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Uhh Jon. I don't think that's super true lol
[10/2/17, 1:52:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah
[10/2/17, 1:53:14 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Actually a common misconception jon
[10/2/17, 1:53:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Those are just the ones that get plastered all over the news
[10/2/17, 1:54:08 PM] Dev Naik: My point exactly
[10/2/17, 1:54:13 PM] Jonathan Ong: When do u ever hear of a Christian terrorist walking into a school and blowing themselves up
[10/2/17, 1:54:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly
[10/2/17, 1:54:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But it happens
[10/2/17, 1:54:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Sandy hook, movie theater, the church bombing in the south
[10/2/17, 1:55:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: No but most of the attacks that happen on US soil has been anything but Islamic extremists
[10/2/17, 1:55:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Vegas
[10/2/17, 1:55:27 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Ethan
[10/2/17, 1:55:46 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: White people have claimed more lives in terrorist attacks than any islamic terrorist after 911
[10/2/17, 1:56:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^^^
[10/2/17, 1:56:37 PM] Jonathan Ong: Yes and those are all terrorists. I'm not saying that the ppl who carried out the attacks at sandy hook aurora columbine or Virginia tech aren't terrorist cuz they definitely are
[10/2/17, 1:58:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But you are saying that they didn't cause most of the terrorism in the modern era. Which is false.
[10/2/17, 1:58:05 PM] Dustin Bradley: Jons a terrorist
[10/2/17, 1:58:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right, but in the united states, name a time when a "radical islamic terrorist" got a high death toll. Even in england and spain and the other day in edmonton, the deaths are low (this sounds awful to say) but they are never as major
[10/2/17, 1:58:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Edomonton had a terrorist attack the day before vegas. How many of you heard that one?
[10/2/17, 1:58:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I saw it because Reddit
[10/2/17, 1:59:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right but any news coverages? Nope
[10/2/17, 2:00:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: None what so ever
[10/2/17, 2:00:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Even Reddit was sparse. And those fuckers cover shit quick
[10/2/17, 2:02:00 PM] Jonathan Ong: http://www.dailywire.com/news/13808/5-facts-proving-christian-extremists-arent-michael-qazvini
[10/2/17, 2:02:22 PM] Jonathan Ong: Kinda related to what we're talking about. Definitely worth a read
[10/2/17, 2:02:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dont use anything that starts with a politically charged statement
[10/2/17, 2:02:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: "The Left's media" automatically means biased
[10/2/17, 2:02:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And dailywire isnt a solid news source
[10/2/17, 2:03:09 PM] Jonathan Ong: Well all media is biased but just take a note of some of the facts
[10/2/17, 2:04:04 PM] Jonathan Ong: Although they do lean to the right I think it's a decent outlet
[10/2/17, 2:05:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The wording of the article is seems very bias dude. I don't think that's a very reliable article.
[10/2/17, 2:05:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just from the synopsis, I can say that is a conservative article bashing liberal ideals
[10/2/17, 2:06:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The first point is also something that has already been debunked
[10/2/17, 2:06:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Just putting this out there isn't very hard to find an unbiased media outlet sometimes
[10/2/17, 2:06:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^
[10/2/17, 2:06:32 PM] Chase Larsen: It is hard sorry
[10/2/17, 2:06:41 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol sorry Ethan
[10/2/17, 2:07:00 PM] Chase Larsen: Like if you go look for it you will find it
[10/2/17, 2:07:15 PM] Chase Larsen: But the big ones are pretty much always biased
[10/2/17, 2:07:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You just gotta know how to research. Use multiple sources confirming
[10/2/17, 2:07:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: This is an editorial opinion piece
[10/2/17, 2:07:40 PM] Chase Larsen: Exactly which not many people know how to
[10/2/17, 2:09:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeah im sorry jon but that article is opinion
[10/2/17, 2:10:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And opinion that isnt even backed by correct facts
[10/2/17, 2:10:10 PM] Jonathan Ong: Yeah I agree chase. The key is to look for multiple sources with different biases whether it's Breitbart or huffington post and find the common ground between them which is usually the facts and statistics. That small middle ground is usually the truth
[10/2/17, 2:10:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly
[10/2/17, 2:12:49 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah that's true
[10/2/17, 2:17:03 PM] Jonathan Ong: And in regard to the article it's definitely biased and mostly opinion, but the stats are reliable. Take everything else with a grain of salt
[10/2/17, 2:24:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-mass-shooting-terrorism-islam?utm_campaign=vox.social&utm_content=voxdotcom&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook
[10/2/17, 2:25:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Here is the opposite
[10/2/17, 2:25:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Btw not saying I agree or disagree with any of these opinions, just sharing
[10/2/17, 2:29:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Oh and apparently Tom Petty had a heart attack and has been unconfirmed as dead
[10/2/17, 2:29:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So this week has been great
[10/2/17, 2:30:20 PM] Chase Larsen: What!!!
[10/2/17, 2:30:26 PM] Chase Larsen: Not tom petty
[10/2/17, 2:30:54 PM] Chase Larsen: Well today's news has just been terrible
[10/2/17, 2:31:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He was brain dead so they pulled the plug. They found him unconscious
[10/2/17, 3:52:13 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Wtf Tom Petty died

[10/4/17, 1:13:24 AM] Owen Gilbert: Read that the shooter may have been planning to do it sooner in September, he was trying to rent out suites at different hotels during a concert with chance
[10/4/17, 1:02:42 PM] Owen Gilbert: Dustin what's happening at Los po????
[10/4/17, 1:03:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Keegan locher said shooter on campus
[10/4/17, 1:03:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And he put his name on his snap too
[10/4/17, 1:03:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And said they caught him
[10/4/17, 1:03:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin you alright?
[10/4/17, 1:03:49 PM] Bryce Olson: Yea I saw that to
[10/4/17, 1:04:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I heard there were no shots though

[10/4/17, 1:05:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Tbh I think people are just super paranoid and crying wolf
[10/4/17, 1:05:27 PM] Chris Cheng: I just texted him
[10/4/17, 1:05:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright

[10/4/17, 1:06:02 PM] Chris Cheng: This is the third day straight
[10/4/17, 1:06:04 PM] Owen Gilbert: Lockdown was lifted at noon, and 2 people were escorted off campus
[10/4/17, 1:06:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya. It’s like USC again lowkey

[10/4/17, 1:21:42 PM] Dustin Bradley: Honestly what a fucking idiot
[10/4/17, 1:22:03 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well joe where the memes at?
[10/4/17, 1:22:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: A nerf gun doesnt even look like a possible real gun
[10/4/17, 1:22:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: White people are crazy
[10/4/17, 1:22:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Why it always a white man

[10/4/17, 1:23:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’d be runnin
[10/4/17, 1:24:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right. That looks like its from Mad Mac

[10/4/17, 1:24:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He’s probably slightly hiding it
[10/4/17, 1:24:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So you can’t see the whole thing
[10/4/17, 1:24:32 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Well the janitor said "long gun" according to owen

[10/4/17, 1:28:54 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ethan... are you a zombie?
[10/4/17, 1:29:10 PM] Chase Larsen: And that's what the gun Mohit sent looked like
[10/4/17, 1:29:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thank you chase
[10/4/17, 1:29:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True. Like the ray gun is the only one that looks remotely close to reality

[10/4/17, 2:08:56 PM] Dustin Bradley: 🤦🏻‍♂
[10/4/17, 2:09:19 PM] Dustin Bradley: At least put some effort into it
[10/4/17, 2:09:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: My guess is he didnt bring it to scare people
[10/4/17, 2:10:41 PM] Owen Gilbert: From police "they had no intent to cause harm or problems"
[10/4/17, 2:20:28 PM] Owen Gilbert: Also there's a shit ton of claims that there were multiple shooters at Vegas, people saying they saw multiple people from that room, and there were shots fired at a different hotel that night as well
[10/4/17, 2:21:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeah hella shit conspiracies. None with actually facts
[10/4/17, 2:45:18 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: There's a video of someone who was front row and had a good video of where the shooting was coming from. Video itself debunks the multiple shooter conspiracy
[10/4/17, 2:45:26 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I'll try and find it
[10/4/17, 2:45:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wasn’t something like that on Reddit tim? I think on r/videos
[10/4/17, 2:48:45 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya I found it. NFSL
[10/4/17, 2:48:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The whole 12th floor conspiracy is easily debunked because the glass isnt broken there. How can someone shoot from the 12th without breaking the window
[10/4/17, 2:48:50 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: NSFL**

[10/4/17, 2:50:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But ya that shit was gruelsome
[10/4/17, 2:56:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That one was almost as bad as the video of the guy in the aftermath
[10/4/17, 2:57:07 PM] Owen Gilbert: Please don't link that

[10/4/17, 2:59:55 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: It's pretty gruesome
[10/4/17, 3:00:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The thing I am most curious about is what they find out about the shooter. Who is he, what happened
[10/4/17, 3:01:21 PM] Owen Gilbert: His girlfriend/roommate came back from the Philippines this morning and the fbi is questioning the fuck out of her now
[10/4/17, 3:08:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^
[10/4/17, 3:08:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I saw on Snapchat she had a double life or some shit. I don’t know what the fuck it has to do with it
[10/4/17, 3:08:57 PM] Owen Gilbert: If anyone wants to read. My cousins were there and they were interviewed. They are ok. Just this kinda hit me differently than anything else. That's why I've been reading up on it a lot.

I don't know any from the left side

[10/7/17, 6:59:19 PM] Chase Larsen: I'll still check out Sam Harris but I'll also check out whatever you suggest
[10/7/17, 6:59:26 PM] Jonathan Ong: Alan Dershowitz
[10/7/17, 7:00:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I would give you real people chase but I don’t watch left wing speakers too much or speakers of politics in general so my judgement is bad.
[10/7/17, 7:02:01 PM] Chase Larsen: That's ok I don't watch them that much either, but the only ones I had seen were Ben Shapiro, and milo. And I didn't care for milo. I think Ben is a good speaker and he has some arguments that I agree with. I just want to open up a little bit and hear both sides
[10/7/17, 7:02:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya I feel it.
[10/7/17, 7:02:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Imma look online for you

[10/30/17, 5:57:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya I don’t think I’d be able to go all the way there
[10/30/17, 6:01:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I wanna say camp? But i don’t know if people would be down in the middle of winter lol
[10/30/17, 6:01:44 PM] Owen Gilbert: If you guys want to just try to find a cabin that's within a reasonable driving distance, I'd be down for that, doesn't need to be a specific place
[10/30/17, 6:02:48 PM] Owen Gilbert: Ya not sure about camping lol, depends on where we go so we aren't freezing
[10/30/17, 6:03:28 PM] Dev Naik: Shit I’m down lmao

[11/1/17, 11:13:04 PM] Chase Larsen: So guys I've been arguing with Dustin and Alex for a long time now apparently they both think the world is flat
[11/1/17, 11:13:11 PM] Chase Larsen: I've tried to
Reason with science
[11/1/17, 11:13:29 PM] Owen Gilbert: Bradley?
[11/1/17, 11:13:34 PM] Chase Larsen: Yep
[11/1/17, 11:13:56 PM] Owen Gilbert: Is he like serious or messing around
[11/1/17, 11:15:12 PM] Chase Larsen: He's kind of messing around but he saying how would I know without pictures from nasa and I've been saying that people from the past with no pictures knew the world was round
[11/1/17, 11:16:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s easy to reason with
[11/1/17, 11:16:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If you go to the ocean and you look across and you have a vast enough view, you see the curvature of the earth to a slight degree
[11/1/17, 11:16:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It wouldn’t be flat
[11/1/17, 11:16:54 PM] Chase Larsen: That's what I said
[11/1/17, 11:16:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya
[11/1/17, 11:17:16 PM] Chase Larsen: He's trying to tell me that I wouldn't know without pictures from nasa
[11/1/17, 11:17:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Whenever arguing with dustin. I just say he is retarded and move on
[11/1/17, 11:17:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lol
[11/1/17, 11:17:29 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Is Dustin retarded?
[11/1/17, 11:17:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah, you could tell without pictures
[11/1/17, 11:17:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Tim rhetorical question?
[11/1/17, 11:17:42 PM] Chase Larsen: That's what I said
[11/1/17, 11:19:09 PM] Chase Larsen: He's kind of kidding around I guess
[11/1/17, 11:20:07 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Sure he is
[11/1/17, 11:20:29 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Alex than is retarded if he actually believes it
[11/1/17, 11:20:46 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya does Alex actually believe it
[11/1/17, 11:20:49 PM] Owen Gilbert: Dustins a flatearther
[11/1/17, 11:20:57 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Hey Dustin do you believe vaccines cause autism?
[11/1/17, 11:21:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because I can see him being that frittata that actually believes it
[11/1/17, 11:21:11 PM] Chase Larsen: No they don't believe it they are trying to
Tell me that I wouldn't know the earth is flat without pictures that's what we have been arguing
[11/1/17, 11:21:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s because both of them probably fell asleep in all their science classes growing up
[11/1/17, 11:21:38 PM] Dustin Bradley: No you Fock and I know the earth is round chase just took my question out of context
[11/1/17, 11:21:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin then what is your question
[11/1/17, 11:22:20 PM] Chase Larsen: It started with a post about Kyrie hahaha
[11/1/17, 11:22:56 PM] Chase Larsen: But yeah they believe the earth is round they just want me to prove it without pictures which I did
[11/1/17, 11:23:01 PM] Chase Larsen: And then they got mad
[11/1/17, 11:25:44 PM] Owen Gilbert: Do what mohit said
[11/1/17, 11:25:50 PM] Owen Gilbert: Go to the ocean and look out
[11/1/17, 11:26:23 PM] Dustin Bradley: I was asking how would a primitive being figure out the world is flat without knowing anything and in what circumstances would they figure it out without having any known knowledge previously?
[11/1/17, 11:26:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What is your definition of primitive. No tools no tech nothing?
[11/1/17, 11:26:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or are we talking medieval
[11/1/17, 11:27:08 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m saying no tools
[11/1/17, 11:27:10 PM] Chase Larsen: Ok that was a totally different question Dustin you asked how would I know personally
[11/1/17, 11:27:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: No tools no tech
[11/1/17, 11:27:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You can easily find that out dustin
[11/1/17, 11:27:48 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Explain gravity if the earth is flat
[11/1/17, 11:28:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^
[11/1/17, 11:30:06 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ooooo fuck I’m an idiot sorry sorry I’m just gonna live outside for the rest of my days
[11/1/17, 11:30:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Explain the sun rising on one side and setting on the other
[11/1/17, 11:30:28 PM] Chase Larsen: Dustin you don't have to
Say that you were just asking a question
[11/1/17, 11:31:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Explain how when you look at the stars over time, they rotate in a circle
[11/1/17, 11:31:15 PM] Joe Stine: But the earth is flat.
[11/1/17, 11:31:27 PM] Chase Larsen: Oh joe confirmed it
[11/1/17, 11:31:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The shadow of something in the eastern hemisphere is longer than the shadow in the western why
[11/1/17, 11:31:41 PM] Joe Stine: Photoshop mohit
[11/1/17, 11:31:43 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ok ok no need to rub in my stupidity

[11/1/17, 11:31:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah you aren’t stupid dustin
[11/1/17, 11:32:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You don’t think it’s flat

[11/2/17, 12:49:16 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: And it’s not a dumb question. It was only recent that humans realized the earth is round. People believed the earth was flat for thousands of years
[11/2/17, 12:50:11 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Well wait
[11/2/17, 12:50:26 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Like the masses believed it was flat
[11/2/17, 12:50:41 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But then the smart people have known since forever
[11/2/17, 12:50:45 AM] Chase Larsen: Yeah that dang church people haha jk
[11/2/17, 12:50:50 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Like 500 bc
[11/2/17, 12:51:07 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Like Pythagoras or some shit
[11/2/17, 12:51:19 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Because the moon is round. The earth has to be round
[11/2/17, 12:51:20 AM] Chase Larsen: You know it's kind of funny that the Greeks and Romans were a lot more advanced then people in the dark ages
[11/2/17, 12:51:29 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya
[11/2/17, 12:51:32 AM] Chase Larsen: Like with everything
[11/2/17, 12:51:44 AM] Chase Larsen: Art, science, plumbing haha
[11/2/17, 12:51:54 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya but what I’m saying is popularly believed. No one believed the smart people back then
[11/2/17, 12:52:04 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahhh ya true. I see what context
[11/2/17, 12:52:16 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I thought you meant it was never thought of
[11/2/17, 12:52:28 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No I would not say that
[11/2/17, 12:53:49 AM] Chase Larsen: Have you guys seen the family guy episode where they go into another dimension and it's super advanced and Stewie is like this is a dimension where the Catholic Church wasn't involved in the world ahahah
[11/2/17, 12:54:31 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No lol but that’s fairly accurate. The CC halted human progress by thousands of years
[11/2/17, 12:54:42 AM] Chase Larsen: Oh definitely

[11/16/17, 3:32:18 PM] Chase Larsen: Dang it really sucks because my brother knows a family down in San Diego that has a
Vacation house at Coronado Island and if he asked to use it for
A party they would say yes but if I asked it would
Probably be no

[11/23/17, 1:39:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Where are you getting the info?
[11/23/17, 1:40:05 PM] Dustin Bradley: My EMT friends sister was on scene when it happened she also was an observer
[11/23/17, 1:41:13 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m sorry there was only one ejected she’s in critical
[11/23/17, 1:41:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: In critical? My sister said the girl she knew was ejected and died
[11/23/17, 1:42:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: She probably was alive when she was found but later died in route to hospital
[11/23/17, 1:42:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You are giving jumbled information
[11/23/17, 1:44:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: All I know is that the driver is dead one ejected I think she’s in critical condition I’m not sure and there were 3 walking wounded
[11/23/17, 1:44:49 PM] Dustin Bradley: The driver was drinking
[11/23/17, 1:45:06 PM] Owen Gilbert: When was this?
[11/23/17, 1:45:11 PM] Dustin Bradley: Last night

[11/23/17, 1:47:17 PM] Dustin Bradley: Smashed
[11/23/17, 1:47:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And the ejected girl is in critical rn?
[11/23/17, 1:47:36 PM] Dustin Bradley: Yes from what I know
[11/23/17, 1:47:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So alive?
[11/23/17, 1:48:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Can you find out and let me know?
[11/23/17, 1:48:41 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ya man
[11/23/17, 1:49:07 PM] Owen Gilbert: Driver was 27
[11/23/17, 1:49:09 PM] Owen Gilbert: 26*
[11/23/17, 1:49:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Where are you getting your info owen
[11/23/17, 1:49:46 PM] Owen Gilbert: Mom found it on abc7
[11/23/17, 1:49:56 PM] Dustin Bradley: It’s on the Pleasanton patch Ethan
[11/23/17, 1:50:26 PM] Owen Gilbert: There's just vague info on the patch
[11/23/17, 1:50:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeah i heard stanley but you said bernal
[11/23/17, 1:50:38 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Read the Livermore patch
[11/23/17, 1:50:47 PM] Dustin Bradley: And they got some info incorrect
[11/23/17, 1:50:57 PM] Dustin Bradley: Which ticks me off
[11/23/17, 1:50:58 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: 16 year old girl partially ejected pronounced dead
[11/23/17, 1:51:19 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: And another person fully ejected pronounced dead
[11/23/17, 1:51:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And driver arrested
[11/23/17, 1:53:08 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well from what I’m receiving the drivers dead and the ejected is in critical
[11/23/17, 1:53:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The patch says the driver was arrested and there are two ejections, one dead, one not
[11/23/17, 1:54:02 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m getting this knowledge from a person who was on scene when this happened who witnessed it
[11/23/17, 1:54:14 PM] Dustin Bradley: ... sooooooo
[11/23/17, 1:54:22 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: So no need to be a dick
[11/23/17, 1:54:34 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m not
[11/23/17, 1:54:48 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Hit me with that 7 letter so
[11/23/17, 1:54:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im just saying, I am trying to figure out what happened and the patch is completely different
[11/23/17, 1:55:23 PM] Dustin Bradley: Because most of it is wrong info
[11/23/17, 1:56:17 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’ll let you guys know more when I get more info
[11/23/17, 1:56:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How did the person witness it
[11/23/17, 1:57:42 PM] Dustin Bradley: Sorry witness was the wrong word she saw the aftermath of the event
[11/23/17, 1:58:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Is she an emt who was working itω
[11/23/17, 1:58:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ?
[11/23/17, 1:58:29 PM] Dustin Bradley: The girl was volunteering on a ride along with the police
[11/23/17, 1:59:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And she was in the police debriefing?
[11/23/17, 1:59:08 PM] Dustin Bradley: And most of the time firefighter and police are first on scene
[11/23/17, 1:59:39 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m not sure Ethan
[11/23/17, 1:59:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Did she have any conversations about the investigation?
[11/23/17, 2:02:34 PM] Owen Gilbert: Don't think they'll release the info of the train until they notify the parents, don't think they want the parents to find out through the news
[11/23/17, 2:02:35 PM] Dustin Bradley: Nope because that’s personal info and violates HIPPA laws she can give general information like age and sex
[11/23/17, 2:02:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The “driver” was probably the 16 yd old who was partially ejected and died. The ejected was the person in the back seat who is alive, and the driver was a 26 yd woman who was arrested. That is the most logical story
‎[11/23/17, 2:03:28 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: ‎image omitted
[11/23/17, 2:03:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^ honestly though
[11/23/17, 2:03:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Sorry dustin, your friend’s sister doesnt know shit
[11/23/17, 2:04:18 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well we won’t know until a patient care report is written
[11/23/17, 2:04:46 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The dead girl is for sure 16, because my sister knows her. And that wasnt the driver
[11/23/17, 2:04:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So that is obviously wrong
[11/23/17, 2:09:14 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Well just have to see once there’s more information
[11/23/17, 2:16:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: LOLOLOL THAT MEME

[11/23/17, 2:18:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No clue
[11/23/17, 2:18:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think she just knew her
[11/23/17, 2:19:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ethan can you give me a tldr, I don’t understand any of the last 90 messages
[11/23/17, 2:20:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: Same
[11/23/17, 2:20:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dustin has a friend who has a sister who was at the scene of the car crash last night and he was telling us what she said about it but after looking on the patch the information doesnt match
[11/23/17, 2:21:16 PM] Cameron Freeman: Maybe it's the government trying to hide what happen
[11/23/17, 2:21:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Wrong
[11/23/17, 2:21:52 PM] Joe Stine: Fake news
[11/23/17, 2:22:14 PM] Owen Gilbert: Well they are hiding the train being there, at least for now
[11/23/17, 2:22:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What I’m reading online is, driver was 26 year old. Drunk. Crashed and flipped and landed on train tracks. 16 year old partially ejected, passed away on scene. Backseat passenger. Fully ejected. Dead.
[11/23/17, 2:22:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Right
[11/23/17, 2:22:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Fully ejected didnt die
[11/23/17, 2:23:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats what we all got from online
[11/23/17, 2:23:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ohhh ya you right
[11/23/17, 2:23:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I read it wrong
[11/23/17, 2:23:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dustin said the driver died and the ejected person did die
[11/23/17, 2:23:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Back seat was just ejected
[11/23/17, 2:23:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Ejected was critically injured*
[11/23/17, 2:23:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Driver didn’t die according to pleasanton patch

[12/2/17, 3:14:22 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I0cUTXwr-k
[12/2/17, 3:22:02 PM] Dev Naik: Bruh I’ve been telling you lmao...
[12/2/17, 3:35:43 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Paging @19259180102. What do you think?
[12/2/17, 3:53:03 PM] Jonathan Ong: It’s a good video. I think at the end of the day, no one wants to hire him because they don’t want to deal with the political BS. The NFL has already become controversial enough with the players kneeling and a team hiring him would add fuel to the fire
[12/2/17, 3:56:57 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That’s a fair argument, but fuck politics. Let the player play because he’s good and leave the controversy to the past
[12/2/17, 3:58:39 PM] Dev Naik: Bunch of bullshit, if someone is good enough to play let them..
[12/2/17, 4:01:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Jon Bois (the creator) made a good point. Kap has no criminal charges, drug abuses, or disciplinary obstructions
[12/2/17, 4:01:53 PM] Dev Naik: There is absolutely nothing wrong with him... he deserves a spot on a team
[12/2/17, 4:02:05 PM] Dev Naik: No room lol...
[12/2/17, 4:02:23 PM] Dev Naik: Whoops by bad wrong chat
[12/2/17, 4:18:47 PM] Jonathan Ong: I wish it were that easy lol.. he’s just been too controversial and hiring him at this point would just be bad business
[12/2/17, 4:32:54 PM] Dev Naik: Not at all... that makes no sense...
[12/2/17, 4:33:02 PM] Dev Naik: How is that bad business lol..
[12/2/17, 4:41:01 PM] Jonathan Ong: Substantial drop in ratings, tv viewership, ppl going to the games or purchasing merchandise. Some of the NFL’s sponsors have been taking a hit too
[12/2/17, 4:41:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its obviously bad business
[12/2/17, 4:42:08 PM] Jonathan Ong: I believe that’s all due to the kneeling controversy and hiring Colin kaepernick won’t help solve those problems
[12/2/17, 4:42:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Half the country hates him. If an nfl team picked him up, their fans might boycott
[12/2/17, 4:46:52 PM] Dev Naik: Half he country loves him
[12/2/17, 4:47:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats not the point
[12/2/17, 4:47:13 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: 50% is bad
[12/2/17, 4:47:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Any bit of bad is gunna hurt the company
[12/2/17, 4:47:50 PM] Dev Naik: Yes it is though, I know hella people boycotting the nfl because if Kaepernick not being on a team, so either way it’s bad
[12/2/17, 4:48:38 PM] Dev Naik: Plus so many people have been going out of their way to get kapernick jerseys and shit
[12/2/17, 4:49:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But that doesnt help a team. No team wants bad pr
[12/2/17, 4:49:25 PM] Dev Naik: And for johns point of hiring kaepernick won’t solve the problem, then why not sign him to make a team better...
[12/2/17, 4:49:59 PM] Dev Naik: Jon’s*
[12/2/17, 4:50:20 PM] Dev Naik: True Ethan but most teams already have that
[12/2/17, 4:50:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So what? Just because you have bad pr doesnt mean you cant get worse.
[12/2/17, 4:51:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Colin also doesn’t fit a lot of schemes nowadays for teams
[12/2/17, 4:51:34 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The Browns should sign him. They are the worst team in the nfl and it’s not like the fans have hope/faith in their team anyways. If anything it might give CLE hope
[12/2/17, 4:51:37 PM] Dev Naik: True, so with that point why doesn’t every team just get rid of everyone who kneels? That would raise the pr right?
[12/2/17, 4:51:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^ thats the argument
[12/2/17, 4:52:01 PM] Dev Naik: Or anyone that doesn’t make everyone happy
[12/2/17, 4:52:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its different having someone on your team, then going out of your way to get public enemy #1
[12/2/17, 4:52:48 PM] Dev Naik: Kapernick shouldn’t be public enemy #1 lmao
[12/2/17, 4:52:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No shit
[12/2/17, 4:54:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dev. I feel like what you say is what everyone agrees to. But it’s just something that won’t happen because of politics. And it’s not like politics will leave most of the industries of the world. It’s always gunna be there. There’s nothing you can do about it.
[12/2/17, 4:54:19 PM] Dev Naik: Even if he is, it shouldn’t matter
[12/2/17, 4:54:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Society is fucked up and it’s something we gotta deal with.
[12/2/17, 4:54:34 PM] Dev Naik: Politics are fucked lmao...
[12/2/17, 4:54:38 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: ^
[12/2/17, 4:54:52 PM] Dev Naik: Humans are actually stupid lol
[12/2/17, 4:55:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course
[12/2/17, 4:55:01 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Collectively
[12/2/17, 4:55:04 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: As a mob
[12/2/17, 4:55:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We are dumb as fuck together
[12/2/17, 4:55:09 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Tim collectively
[12/2/17, 4:55:31 PM] Dev Naik: Everyone thinks in a human centric way, which needs to change lmao...
[12/2/17, 4:55:54 PM] Dev Naik: We aren’t at the center of this earth, we can survive without the world, but it can survive without us
[12/2/17, 4:57:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dev. Just because you don’t care about politics and think it shouldn’t matter, doesn’t mean thats how it will be. NFL teams are billion dollar businesses. They care greatly about politics
[12/2/17, 4:57:43 PM] Jonathan Ong: It’s just reality. U can’t be in a high profile stage as in Colin kaepernicks case and make politically charged statements 
w/o any consequences
[12/2/17, 4:57:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just like ray rice
[12/2/17, 4:58:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Ray rice was one of the best rbs in the past 15 years
[12/2/17, 4:58:25 PM] Dev Naik: Ray rice committed a crime...
[12/2/17, 4:58:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So what?
[12/2/17, 4:58:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So did half the league
[12/2/17, 4:58:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its the fact that he is high profile and bad pr
[12/2/17, 4:58:57 PM] Dev Naik: And Kaep didn’t
[12/2/17, 4:58:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just like kaep
[12/2/17, 4:59:39 PM] Dev Naik: The NFL corporations should all be owned by the fans like the packers
[12/2/17, 4:59:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats an opinion
[12/2/17, 4:59:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^
[12/2/17, 5:00:11 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No shit ethan lol
[12/2/17, 5:00:22 PM] Dev Naik: Get the big business out of here, it’s a game for the fans, why not have it owned by the fans, without them the nfl wouldn’t be Ajit
[12/2/17, 5:00:24 PM] Dev Naik: Shit*
[12/2/17, 5:00:25 PM] Dev Naik: Lol
[12/2/17, 5:00:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Obviously. No one disagrees
[12/2/17, 5:00:56 PM] Dev Naik: And that way whatever happens to the team is based on the fans and makes everyone happy
[12/2/17, 5:01:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Except the fans who voted against it
[12/2/17, 5:01:52 PM] Dev Naik: True, then they shouldn’t be mad about people signing players that they don’t like
[12/2/17, 5:02:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What
[12/2/17, 5:02:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They dont like them, why would they be happy
[12/2/17, 5:02:49 PM] Dev Naik: But it’s making their team better arguably
[12/2/17, 5:03:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Not necessarily true
[12/2/17, 5:03:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just like you are mad he isnt being signed, they can be mad about him being signed
[12/2/17, 5:03:53 PM] Dev Naik: I’m mad because he isn’t on a team even though he can help a team be better
[12/2/17, 5:04:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But thats not true
[12/2/17, 5:04:12 PM] Dev Naik: Let me rephrase
[12/2/17, 5:04:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He can help the team be better but at what cost
[12/2/17, 5:04:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If he doesnt fit the scheme, he wont do well. If the team surrounding him is poor, he wont do well
[12/2/17, 5:04:32 PM] Dev Naik: He is better than a lot of of qbs
[12/2/17, 5:04:55 PM] Dev Naik: I mean if you don’t want your team to have a better player that’s on you
[12/2/17, 5:05:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The team losing millions in fans not going to games, games not being watched, concession stands not selling food
[12/2/17, 5:05:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its not like madden where you pick the best players and it works. Schemes make a huge difference. Brett Hundley is a mobile QB, but he is in a pocket passing scheme and has done pooly
[12/2/17, 5:05:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Poorly*
[12/2/17, 5:05:52 PM] Dev Naik: Mohit, that’s why I think nfl teams should be owned by fans
[12/2/17, 5:05:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You’re hurting not just the team, and the NFL but also the concessions and all the people around them.
[12/2/17, 5:06:03 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: He has the potential to make a team better, but from the offensive side. The defense/special teams are not effected directly.
[12/2/17, 5:06:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But what would that change dev
[12/2/17, 5:06:32 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You will have unqualified people arguing about whats best
[12/2/17, 5:06:53 PM] Dev Naik: People being more invested in their team because they own a part of them
[12/2/17, 5:07:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya Dev, but how would that just up and change just because one guy who made himself public enemy by saying political statements that may be true and rightful, but still opposing statements, isn’t going on a team?
[12/2/17, 5:07:11 PM] Dev Naik: And whether they go to the games and get tickets is on them because they own the team
[12/2/17, 5:07:46 PM] Dev Naik: The bigger problem I’m getting at I guess is that people need to change
[12/2/17, 5:07:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But that’s not gunna happen fosho.
[12/2/17, 5:08:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: People are always gunna be dumb as shit
[12/2/17, 5:08:59 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly.. I’m just trying to discuss something that can lead to progression in not only the nfl but humanity in general
[12/2/17, 5:09:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Duh
[12/2/17, 5:09:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True i understand
[12/2/17, 5:09:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But what I’m saying is, why is the NFL and kap such an issue, when we can’t even get our own dumb ass president to agree that climate change and science is real. It’s kinda a nonissue
[12/2/17, 5:09:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya see what I mean?
[12/2/17, 5:10:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its media
[12/2/17, 5:10:13 PM] Dev Naik: I know... I’m just trying to get at something smaller and work to something bigger
[12/2/17, 5:10:34 PM] Dev Naik: Of course we can go right into the big picture of things but it’s better to start smaller
[12/2/17, 5:10:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But when the bigger problem could kill us in the next 20-50 years, I think it’s better to start with the bigger and stop pushing the smaller problems forward
[12/2/17, 5:11:07 PM] Dev Naik: True but some people don’t listen right away lol
[12/2/17, 5:11:35 PM] Dev Naik: People turn that fact away before even listening so by starting something smaller, you can work your way to that spot
[12/2/17, 5:12:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t know man. It baffles me to see people worried about small stuff like sports, movies, media all that. But they don’t see the bigger issues at hand. Granted. I’m doing nothing to help. But it’s an issue to bring forward non issues and make them main issues
[12/2/17, 5:14:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its because of the media
[12/2/17, 5:15:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course it is.
[12/2/17, 5:15:36 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: To some degree it can be the media’s fault but it’s also just peoples fault
[12/2/17, 5:15:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You said it like 3 times bruh lol
[12/2/17, 5:15:41 PM] Dev Naik: Trust me I know... it’s ridiculous that people don’t worry about these huge issues, but they literally choose not to believe it.. and trying to talk to them about it doesn’t change much right away, starting with other topics and moving in that direction gets more of their attention and you can maybe get more out of it
[12/2/17, 5:15:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And tim that’s true.
[12/2/17, 5:15:53 PM] Dev Naik: It’s fosho peoples fault
[12/2/17, 5:16:04 PM] Dev Naik: Of course media as well but who runs the media
[12/2/17, 5:16:10 PM] Dev Naik: And who listens to the media
[12/2/17, 5:17:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You have asked the same question. Gave you the same answer
[12/2/17, 5:17:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And media is nothing without people. So that is my point
[12/2/17, 5:17:43 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Not necessarily the right answer
[12/2/17, 5:18:25 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Ethan I agree
[12/2/17, 5:18:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I never asked a question. I knew the answer.
[12/2/17, 5:18:53 PM] Dev Naik: But on a real note what are everyone’s thoughts on climate change I want to know?
[12/2/17, 5:19:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The question you asked implicitly is why people are worried about small stuff
[12/2/17, 5:20:10 PM] Dev Naik: This is true Mohit
[12/2/17, 5:21:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I never asked why they are worried about small stuff. I said it’s dumb that they are worried about small stuff. It’s a waste of time. I know the media pushes their own agendas because of politics and the people are too stupid and brainwashed to discern fact from opinion
[12/2/17, 5:21:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But I understand ethan
[12/2/17, 5:21:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right.m
[12/2/17, 5:21:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Same page. Same team
[12/2/17, 5:22:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yep
[12/2/17, 5:22:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Unlike kap
[12/2/17, 5:22:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sorry
[12/2/17, 5:22:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You set it up
[12/2/17, 5:22:31 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: /r/MorbidReality
[12/2/17, 5:22:46 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Climate change is real. But it isnt this monumental issue that needs to be addressed. Plus the earth is already declining so fast that is is irreversible
[12/2/17, 5:22:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Imo^
[12/2/17, 5:23:53 PM] Dev Naik: Hmmm
[12/2/17, 5:24:23 PM] Dev Naik: I don’t necessarily agree
[12/2/17, 5:25:46 PM] Dev Naik: Yes it’s real, but it’s needs to be addressed
[12/2/17, 5:25:50 PM] Jonathan Ong: It’s because the “small stuff” ie sports, tv, etc is what’s relevant in ppls lives. Ppl generally don’t spend time worrying a lot about the “big things” such as how pulling out of the Paris climate agreement will affect their lives or how NK has a long range ballistic missile capable of reaching the US
[12/2/17, 5:27:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: LOL
[12/2/17, 5:28:20 PM] Dev Naik: Lol I never heard him say that it isn’t though
[12/2/17, 5:28:36 PM] Jonathan Ong: Climate change is real but I agree with Ethan saying it isn’t a issue that needs to be immediately addressed. I think there is too much evidence to deny that it exists but the question is to what extent, and what are we willing to sacrifice to address this problem
[12/2/17, 5:29:08 PM] Dev Naik: The future of your children isn’t important?
[12/2/17, 5:29:21 PM] Dev Naik: And what evidence
[12/2/17, 5:29:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: My children wont be affecred
[12/2/17, 5:29:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Nor will their children
[12/2/17, 5:29:47 PM] Dev Naik: How so? We are already being affected
[12/2/17, 5:29:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How so
[12/2/17, 5:30:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Show me where it says before 2100 we will be fucked
[12/2/17, 5:30:12 PM] Jonathan Ong: Cuz there’s a lot of conflicting evidence out there. My main disagreement is that the left likes to push the notion that more economically damaging regulations and laws will fix this problem but it won’t
[12/2/17, 5:30:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t know man the decaprio movie was pretty fucking scary
[12/2/17, 5:30:41 PM] Dev Naik: The ozone is depleting...
[12/2/17, 5:30:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: At what rate?
[12/2/17, 5:31:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its been depleting for centuries
[12/2/17, 5:31:05 PM] Dev Naik: Faster than we want it to
[12/2/17, 5:31:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right, but what does that mean
[12/2/17, 5:31:54 PM] Dev Naik: That we as a race are going to destroy the earth because of selfish needs
[12/2/17, 5:32:05 PM] Dev Naik: And that goes for everyone, myself included
[12/2/17, 5:32:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But when dev
[12/2/17, 5:32:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dev I agree with you but your arguments are terrible
[12/2/17, 5:32:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m sorry
[12/2/17, 5:32:46 PM] Jonathan Ong: Dev, our technology will continue to improve to a point where we will become more efficient and put out less pollution. And we’re not destroying the world lol
[12/2/17, 5:32:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Facts bruh.
[12/2/17, 5:32:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We need em
[12/2/17, 5:33:01 PM] Dev Naik: Maybe not today or tomorrow but our children and the future will be affected...
[12/2/17, 5:33:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: WHOSE CHILDREN
[12/2/17, 5:33:19 PM] Dev Naik: Ours
[12/2/17, 5:33:21 PM] Jonathan Ong: The research that’s out now won’t be relevant in 50 years
[12/2/17, 5:33:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: My direct children wont be affected any more than i will
[12/2/17, 5:33:53 PM] Dev Naik: But why force it on then to change after damages are being done.. why not change now to make it easier for the future and th earth to be conserved
[12/2/17, 5:34:14 PM] Dev Naik: But the effects of it will John
[12/2/17, 5:34:18 PM] Dev Naik: Jon*
[12/2/17, 5:34:44 PM] Jonathan Ong: U don’t know that.. none of us do
[12/2/17, 5:34:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Changes are being made. My point is that everyday people like us shouldn’t change anything. Solar panels, electric cars, all created by people far above us
[12/2/17, 5:35:08 PM] Dev Naik: Yes but what we do can help conserve the earth
[12/2/17, 5:35:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What do you suggest then?
[12/2/17, 5:35:49 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: What about waste output, carbon footprint, regular day to day pollution, littering @19256993963

[12/2/17, 5:36:07 PM] Dev Naik: I don’t know do things that produce less waste? Conserve water, conserve our resources and lower our pollution?
[12/2/17, 5:36:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But what would that change
[12/2/17, 5:36:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It would...it would change a lot
[12/2/17, 5:36:41 PM] Dev Naik: Our carbon footprints are huge
[12/2/17, 5:36:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Give me stats on length of time

[12/2/17, 5:36:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What change my current activities will do
[12/2/17, 5:36:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The amount of gases we release into the air

[12/2/17, 5:38:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya
[12/2/17, 5:38:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I get what a carbon footprint does. I already agreed that it exists but my point is it is irreversible, AND that unless it happens in the next couple centuries, i personally don’t give enough of a shit
[12/2/17, 5:38:41 PM] Dev Naik: Why lol
[12/2/17, 5:38:47 PM] Dev Naik: Why don’t you care?
[12/2/17, 5:38:52 PM] Dev Naik: Why shouldn’t you care?
[12/2/17, 5:38:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why should I?
[12/2/17, 5:39:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: India is actually growing to lower their carbon footprint faster than the US is. And is shitting on the US. So it’s litt
[12/2/17, 5:39:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Overpopulation is a bigger issue than me not recycling
[12/2/17, 5:39:15 PM] Dev Naik: Because what you do today affects what happens in the future
[12/2/17, 5:39:35 PM] Dev Naik: Well if the population all is like you then we are fucked
[12/2/17, 5:40:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: We are fucked regardless. The earth isn’t intended to have 7+ billion people on it
[12/2/17, 5:40:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I agree with Dev on this though. You saying I don’t care is like Ethan, why would I care now about my grades when I can just let future mohit try to grind it out and ace the final. But when the final comes around. I look back like, damn fuck during the semester mohit. He was a piece of shit
[12/2/17, 5:40:23 PM] Dev Naik: So the overpopulation is at a different scale than you yourself
[12/2/17, 5:40:48 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I would like to make a statement that the residence of 995 E William St does recycle as a collective
[12/2/17, 5:41:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: DAMN ETHAN YOU HYPOCRITE WHY YOU RECYCLING IF YOU DONT CARE
[12/2/17, 5:41:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No, that affects me. 300 years from now, the world is a different place. 300 years before us, was a different place
[12/2/17, 5:41:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Thank you tim for that PSA
[12/2/17, 5:41:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its called being Devil’s Advocate
[12/2/17, 5:41:33 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ethan’s giving us bad PR
[12/2/17, 5:41:46 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Maybe we should kick him out
[12/2/17, 5:41:58 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: And not let any household in America except him
[12/2/17, 5:42:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ethan = Colin Kaepernick
[12/2/17, 5:42:30 PM] Dev Naik: Yes because the world is changing Ethan... we have to change with it

[12/2/17, 5:42:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: It’s gone full circle boys. Pack your bags
[12/2/17, 5:42:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You guys were talking about the small issues and shit like that? Climate change FOR ME, is not a large issue
[12/2/17, 5:43:06 PM] Dev Naik: Why not though?
[12/2/17, 5:43:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The world changes by invention. I have no invention to give but when it is made, I use it
[12/2/17, 5:43:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Because I have more important shit that affects me
[12/2/17, 5:43:27 PM] Dev Naik: That’s selfish lol
[12/2/17, 5:43:33 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes it is
[12/2/17, 5:43:40 PM] Dev Naik: This is what I was saying earlier that people need to change
[12/2/17, 5:43:46 PM] Dev Naik: Too human centric
[12/2/17, 5:43:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why would I care about someone else’s problem when it might hurt me
[12/2/17, 5:44:04 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ethan’s argument makes perfect sense from a egotistical pov
[12/2/17, 5:44:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Selfishness is a human trait, not a characteristic
[12/2/17, 5:44:29 PM] Dev Naik: So why not change that?
[12/2/17, 5:44:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ....its innate
[12/2/17, 5:45:01 PM] Jonathan Ong: Dev it’s not fair to say that he is selfish when he simply disagrees with u
[12/2/17, 5:45:08 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Dev doesn’t mean change it he means suppress it
[12/2/17, 5:45:16 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Tim
[12/2/17, 5:45:33 PM] Dev Naik: And Jon you obviously don’t get my point then...
[12/2/17, 5:45:52 PM] Jonathan Ong: There are countless more pressing things to address than what our climate could or could not potentially be in 50 years
[12/2/17, 5:46:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^
[12/2/17, 5:46:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: All the way full circle back to Mohit’s point
[12/2/17, 5:47:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: YES
[12/2/17, 5:47:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Mohit makes good points.
[12/2/17, 5:47:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Obviously I am not going to make my carbon footprint larger, that is not my point.
[12/2/17, 5:47:56 PM] Dev Naik: Why not make it smaller
[12/2/17, 5:48:16 PM] Dev Naik: Even a little for a start
[12/2/17, 5:48:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Alright. Give me one way to do so that isn’t recycling or the standard things
[12/2/17, 5:49:04 PM] Dev Naik: Don’t eat processed meats
[12/2/17, 5:49:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Like what?
[12/2/17, 5:49:24 PM] Dev Naik: Processed meats
[12/2/17, 5:49:28 PM] Dev Naik: ?
[12/2/17, 5:49:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Aw hell nah Dev
[12/2/17, 5:49:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You lost my vote
[12/2/17, 5:49:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: All meat is processed technically
[12/2/17, 5:50:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You will never take bacon steaks or any meat away from me
[12/2/17, 5:50:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: fuck that
[12/2/17, 5:50:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im not going vegetarian because it may or may not make the earth slow down its decay rate
[12/2/17, 5:50:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’ll give up anything but that
[12/2/17, 5:50:24 PM] Dev Naik: Not all meat just processed meat lol...
[12/2/17, 5:50:26 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: He never said going vegetarian ethan lmao
[12/2/17, 5:50:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Explain then, thats why I said like what

[12/2/17, 5:50:51 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Are you 5. Do we have to explain everything to you?
[12/2/17, 5:50:58 PM] Dev Naik: You look it up then if you don’t know what processed meats are
[12/2/17, 5:51:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If you are making an argument, yes
[12/2/17, 5:51:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What is an example of a popular processed meat
[12/2/17, 5:51:12 PM] Dev Naik: First of all it’s not healthy for you..
[12/2/17, 5:51:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fuck the healthy argument I barely eat salad idgaf
[12/2/17, 5:51:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What does not healthy mean
[12/2/17, 5:51:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fuck my health
[12/2/17, 5:51:39 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya but we’re making an argument on the assumption you are at the same basic knowledge as us

[12/2/17, 5:52:23 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Lmao true^
[12/2/17, 5:52:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How long? How much do I need to eat?
[12/2/17, 5:52:25 PM] Dev Naik: Processed meat is any meat that is processed in order to improve taste or shelf life
[12/2/17, 5:52:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Is a hotdog processed
[12/2/17, 5:52:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So most meat used
[12/2/17, 5:52:41 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Now Ethan’s being a grade A cunt
[12/2/17, 5:52:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cuz I will forever go to Costco and get hotdogs
[12/2/17, 5:52:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No, I am being serious
[12/2/17, 5:52:50 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Mohit
[12/2/17, 5:53:10 PM] Dev Naik: Get local meats...
[12/2/17, 5:53:10 PM] Jonathan Ong: Does spam count? I love that shit cuz I’m a fat fuck
[12/2/17, 5:53:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dollar fiddy is too good a deal

[12/2/17, 5:53:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But can’t have that too often
[12/2/17, 5:53:37 PM] Dev Naik: Yes spam counts is that even a question?
[12/2/17, 5:53:44 PM] Jonathan Ong: It was a joke lol
[12/2/17, 5:53:50 PM] Dev Naik: Ok I though so lol
[12/2/17, 5:53:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: My point is all about how long it will take and how much my direct actions will be affected. I haven’t heard anything to make me wrong
[12/2/17, 5:54:19 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Processed food aren’t bad for you if you eat once in a while but Ethan you only eat out so it’s safe to assume almost all the meat you eat is processed
[12/2/17, 5:54:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Damn lol
[12/2/17, 5:54:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So you are telling me that going to a grocery store and buying meat off the shelf is safe?
[12/2/17, 5:55:12 PM] Dev Naik: Ethan, your only argument is pretty much, “how long will it take? If it doesn’t affect me, I don’t care”
[12/2/17, 5:55:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: Guys key word moderation
[12/2/17, 5:55:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes. That is my point
[12/2/17, 5:55:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo highkey this discussion is so entertaining. I’m hyped the fuck off some strong coffee and it’s amazing.
[12/2/17, 5:55:43 PM] Dev Naik: And if you buy the right meat yes Ethan that’s a very selfish viewpoint as I’ve said before
[12/2/17, 5:55:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I never denied that
[12/2/17, 5:56:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ethan is pretty much saying. Hey, how much will it bother me now versus how much is the danger in the future. And he’s taking the danger in the future route.
[12/2/17, 5:56:10 PM] Dev Naik: Alright then
[12/2/17, 5:56:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And if it is, too bad. I am not a selfish person for not caring what happens centuries after I die
[12/2/17, 5:56:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nothing wrong with that
[12/2/17, 5:56:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thank you
[12/2/17, 5:56:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because that’s me with a lot of things
[12/2/17, 5:56:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So I see you ethan
[12/2/17, 5:56:51 PM] Dev Naik: This is how humans are fucked up lol
[12/2/17, 5:56:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yes we are Dev
[12/2/17, 5:57:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But like 🤷🏽‍♂️
[12/2/17, 5:57:06 PM] Dev Naik: SO WHY NOT CHANGE
[12/2/17, 5:57:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We do change. I don’t do a lot of shit because I’m not trying to fuck the earth up.
[12/2/17, 5:57:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But I look at the pros versus cons on some things. Like meat
[12/2/17, 5:57:44 PM] Dev Naik: That’s you to Ethan’s and Ethan to other people
[12/2/17, 5:58:03 PM] Dev Naik: You can get the same meat, that’s better for the environment though....
[12/2/17, 5:58:12 PM] Dev Naik: Or be a baller like Bryce and hunt lol
[12/2/17, 5:58:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Do I have the funds to go buy meat that isn’t processed and cook it now. Or am I gunna go to Costco and buy a hotdog. Shit I have a paper due. Hot dog it is.
[12/2/17, 5:58:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m not eating deer lol
[12/2/17, 5:58:38 PM] Jonathan Ong: What does that even mean?
[12/2/17, 5:58:41 PM] Dev Naik: Never said you had to hunt deer lol I’m just giving an example
[12/2/17, 5:58:50 PM] Dev Naik: Meat from local places and not from farms
[12/2/17, 5:59:06 PM] Dev Naik: Meats that don’t require a ridiculously high carbon footprint
[12/2/17, 6:01:10 PM] Dev Naik: And Im not saying to not eat meat... just eat meat that’s healthier for you and the environment..
[12/2/17, 6:06:20 PM] Dustin Bradley: Can you give examples of meats that are healthier for the environment Dev?
[12/2/17, 6:06:40 PM] Dev Naik: Grass fed not processed
[12/2/17, 6:06:45 PM] Dev Naik: Not in factories
[12/2/17, 6:06:56 PM] Dev Naik: I just said it
[12/2/17, 6:07:24 PM] Dev Naik: Look into it more
[12/2/17, 6:14:12 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ooooo guys I’m pretty sure you already know this but it is speculated that humans are maturing physically faster due to the steroid use in mostly all processed foods but not all and that people’s bodies are taking longer to decompose due to the high amounts of preservatives
[12/2/17, 6:14:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But processed foods have their own benefits. Everything has pros and cons
[12/2/17, 6:19:06 PM] Dustin Bradley: True
[12/2/17, 6:19:37 PM] Dev Naik: What benefits?
[12/2/17, 6:19:58 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Dustin that’s very true
[12/2/17, 6:23:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Grass fed takes more labor and water for livestock
[12/2/17, 6:23:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And technically more livestock means more methane
[12/2/17, 6:23:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And its more expensive
[12/2/17, 6:25:25 PM] Dev Naik: It’s more of a issue with processed foods, and obviously going vegan is the best option because every animal based product isnt good, but these options are better than processed meats
[12/2/17, 6:26:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Good for what? Your health? The earth? Protein and dairy are integral parts
[12/2/17, 6:26:09 PM] Jonathan Ong: LOL vegans are cancer
[12/2/17, 6:26:17 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: LMAO
[12/2/17, 6:26:18 PM] Dev Naik: Health and for the environment
[12/2/17, 6:26:32 PM] Dev Naik: With that being said I’m not going vegan lol
[12/2/17, 6:29:30 PM] Dev Naik: But also doesn’t more labor create more jobs Ethan?
[12/2/17, 6:30:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Not jobs. Labor as in physical work
[12/2/17, 6:30:38 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Wow Dev Strawman fallacy
[12/2/17, 6:31:01 PM] Dev Naik: Physical work is a job
[12/2/17, 6:32:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Aight nvm lol this is pointless
[12/2/17, 6:32:07 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao Tim
[12/2/17, 6:32:35 PM] Dev Naik: Yes people are selfish assholes that don’t want to change to better the world around them

[12/2/17, 6:50:56 PM] Chris Cheng: For the record, i'm really glad our group is capable of discussing these issues. Some people might get too triggered and start throwing jabs. But with us, everyone can say things and it would be respected. Jokes will be thrown in too lol. Idk. Im just really proud to be a part of it.

[12/11/17, 11:51:22 AM] Dev Naik: This is true Mohit, but I think he means relatively in life people consider their primes as the college years
[12/11/17, 11:51:30 AM] Dev Naik: Ya what Cam??
[12/11/17, 11:52:04 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya but when some people are juggling like work and school and projects right now, it’s not their prime. My career is gunna be a lot more free than I am now.
[12/11/17, 11:52:04 AM] Cameron Freeman: i don't mean prime as prime i mean this is our prime party age like our prime years to be young wild and free without being tied down to a career and family and stuff
[12/11/17, 11:52:16 AM] Dev Naik: Never said that was our plan, just added it to the list along with barting to sf
[12/11/17, 11:53:33 AM] Dev Naik: Mohit, but when you have a family and career, you are gonna have to juggle more than what you do now
[12/11/17, 11:53:34 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But not everyone has the opportunity to party and go wild cam. We understand what you are saying. But you are thinking about it from your perspective and your freedom. Not others
[12/11/17, 11:53:45 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thank god someone said it
[12/11/17, 11:54:00 AM] Cameron Freeman: i don't understand
[12/11/17, 11:54:02 AM] Cameron Freeman: u do
[12/11/17, 11:54:12 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m not gunna have a family right when I get outta college though Dev. I’m gunna have my years of freedom.
[12/11/17, 11:54:14 AM] Dev Naik: This I agree with that, I don’t have time for shit in college but that why when we are on break we should do something!!!
[12/11/17, 11:54:27 AM] Cameron Freeman: thats what im saying
[12/11/17, 11:54:27 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But I don’t even have time on break is what I am saying
[12/11/17, 11:54:33 AM] Dev Naik: I mean you don’t know that lmao
[12/11/17, 11:54:36 AM] Cameron Freeman: u don't have time on new years eve to party
[12/11/17, 11:54:41 AM] Cameron Freeman: and possibly the night before
[12/11/17, 11:54:49 AM] Dev Naik: What do you have to do on maybe like 2 days
[12/11/17, 11:55:13 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: WHICH IS WHY SOCAL MAKES NO SENSE CAMERON. WHY TAKE A TWO DAY SOCAL TRIP?
[12/11/17, 11:55:23 AM] Cameron Freeman: why not??
[12/11/17, 11:55:27 AM] Cameron Freeman: its the experience
[12/11/17, 11:55:30 AM] Mohit Veligenti: No I understand that, I’m thinking for the entire week. Try having to study for like 7-8 interviews per week as a CS major. You have no idea how intense it is.
[12/11/17, 11:55:48 AM] Cameron Freeman: no i bet it is! no one said anything about the entire week bro
[12/11/17, 11:55:59 AM] Dev Naik: Trust me Mohit I know, but all work and no play is the worst way to live
[12/11/17, 11:56:02 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I am not going to spend more time traveling in a car or train than actually being there
[12/11/17, 11:56:11 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m not trying to take 2 days and do a half ass trip to SoCal when I can do a whole ass trip to SF
[12/11/17, 11:56:23 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: This
[12/11/17, 11:56:25 AM] Cameron Freeman: aight bro! we just see it two different ways i guess
[12/11/17, 11:56:34 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly the point cam
[12/11/17, 11:56:35 AM] Dev Naik: I agree Ethan, and we don’t have to go to SoCal it’s just an idea
[12/11/17, 11:56:43 AM] Mohit Veligenti: And Dev nobody said all work and no play is what I’m doing. I play but there’s limitations.
[12/11/17, 11:56:51 AM] Dev Naik: But the car or train ride there is part of the experience
[12/11/17, 11:57:13 AM] Dev Naik: Which are what Mohit?
[12/11/17, 11:57:19 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I have done that car ride plenty of times, it isnt that great
[12/11/17, 11:57:30 AM] Cameron Freeman: a roadtrip with the boys was part of the fun in my eyes
[12/11/17, 11:57:31 AM] Dev Naik: What are your limitations? We can work along with those
[12/11/17, 11:57:48 AM] Cameron Freeman: iv driven to and from LA 9 times this year and everytime was a blast
[12/11/17, 11:57:50 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Jesus. Alright. I can talk about this later. I have a final in 2 hours.
[12/11/17, 11:57:56 AM] Cameron Freeman: forsure bro good luck
[12/11/17, 11:58:17 AM] Dev Naik: Oh shit ya let’s put this on hold
[12/11/17, 11:58:23 AM] Dev Naik: Good luck bro!
[12/12/17, 7:50:17 AM] Chris Cheng: I literally flew up from socal.
[12/12/17, 10:59:55 AM] Owen Gilbert: So, my house has maybe become an option for new years. My mom actually suggested it lol, she said they are probably going camping and they'll let me have all you guys over, with the one rule of everyone that drinks, stays over. And not to trash the house. It's still a maybe but I'll keep you guys updated. Does that sound good to everyone if they can go?
[12/12/17, 11:03:23 AM] Bryce Olson: Yup I’m down
[12/12/17, 11:11:00 AM] Dev Naik: I think we should add it to the list and still look to do something else
[12/12/17, 11:11:27 AM] Mohit Veligenti: ^ we can add it to the list and vote at the end
[12/12/17, 11:13:14 AM] Dev Naik: Yeet

[12/19/17, 4:03:47 PM] Owen Gilbert: Besides Timmy and Ethan, who else doesn't like/isn't able to do Merced. I know sf is thrown in here as an option but like, how. What would we do, air bnb is out, everything's booked, too expensive, or isn't what we want. And if you guys wanted to just walk the streets, that'd be no drinking maybe, at least for people that are underage and it'd be cold as fuck. We got 2 weeks, what we doing
[12/19/17, 4:09:45 PM] Chris Cheng: Im good with merced, but it’s gunna be sausage fest
[12/19/17, 4:11:42 PM] Dev Naik: Let’s try to find an air bnb around San Fran, maybe suasalito?
[12/19/17, 4:12:36 PM] Dev Naik: And I’d rather not have a sausage fest
[12/19/17, 4:14:18 PM] Owen Gilbert: Why would Merced be a sausage fest but an air bnb not be
[12/19/17, 4:14:26 PM] Owen Gilbert: Especially in sf
[12/19/17, 4:14:38 PM] Dev Naik: Less people would be down to go to Merced
[12/19/17, 4:15:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why would we air bnb in san fran
[12/19/17, 4:15:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats retarded. Bart there, bart back
[12/19/17, 4:16:01 PM] Owen Gilbert: But why lol, Merced and sf/Sausalito is around the same distance/time
[12/19/17, 4:16:11 PM] Owen Gilbert: And do what Ethan, go where?
[12/19/17, 4:17:03 PM] Dev Naik: So we can stay there Ethan?
[12/19/17, 4:17:18 PM] Dev Naik: And Owen because it’s San Francisco compared to Merced

[12/19/17, 4:23:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You guys are dumb lol. I will probably be working anyways so it dont matter. We do a house party every year, it doesnt matter the location of the house. SF will def have a live countdown and fireworks and it would actually be new to spend time in the city rather than just being at a house. Drinking can be done after, that really isnt that important
[12/19/17, 4:23:36 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cameron...
[12/19/17, 4:23:41 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I’ll fight you
[12/19/17, 4:24:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: Im going to have to disagree on the dumb part. I do not think you are seeying the big picture.
[12/19/17, 4:24:27 PM] Dev Naik: But Ethan my point is that we do that and then go to an air bnb
[12/19/17, 4:24:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Honestly bro. I wish a nigga would
[12/19/17, 4:24:56 PM] Owen Gilbert: So like you wanna go to the city on Bart, and after the countdown, go back on Bart and go to someone's house to drink?
[12/19/17, 4:25:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Find one. Its so last minute so they either wont be available or they will be super expensive
[12/19/17, 4:25:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly
[12/19/17, 4:25:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's not last min at all
[12/19/17, 4:25:16 PM] Dev Naik: Who’s house??
[12/19/17, 4:25:20 PM] Owen Gilbert: It's gonna be like 2am before we get to someone's house though
[12/19/17, 4:25:25 PM] Dev Naik: And Ethan I’ve been trying to lol
[12/19/17, 4:25:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's lame as shit
[12/19/17, 4:25:48 PM] Owen Gilbert: We went to sleep and 5 last year
[12/19/17, 4:25:54 PM] Owen Gilbert: At 5*
[12/19/17, 4:26:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Because everyone was drunk at 10
[12/19/17, 4:26:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: LOL that's when I go out owen
[12/19/17, 4:26:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not everyone 😬
[12/19/17, 4:26:14 PM] Dev Naik: Not everyone Ethan
[12/19/17, 4:26:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ahaha
[12/19/17, 4:26:27 PM] Dev Naik: Hahaha
[12/19/17, 4:26:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Obviously its an exagerration you shits
[12/19/17, 4:26:53 PM] Dev Naik: Yes, yes it was
[12/19/17, 4:27:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t know what you talking about everyone. Most of the group wasn’t hammered.
[12/19/17, 4:27:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Only like Bryce and Tim I think
[12/19/17, 4:27:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah I think u meant to say Timmy Ethan
[12/19/17, 4:27:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But both of them were alive and lit af
[12/19/17, 4:27:34 PM] Chris Cheng: I wasn’t here last new years
[12/19/17, 4:27:35 PM] Chris Cheng: Lol
[12/19/17, 4:27:50 PM] Dev Naik: Either way that’s besides the point lol...
[12/19/17, 4:28:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hold up.
[12/19/17, 4:28:18 PM] Dev Naik: We don’t have a place to go here which is why we should find somewhere in the city or close by to the city
[12/19/17, 4:28:35 PM] Chris Cheng: What if we do something during the day? And then go to someone’s house at like 10:30. Start drinking. Then we’ll all be lit for the countdown
[12/19/17, 4:28:45 PM] Dev Naik: Who’s house lol....
[12/19/17, 4:28:50 PM] Owen Gilbert: That's thing, who's housee
[12/19/17, 4:28:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Guys
‎[12/19/17, 4:28:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ‎image omitted
[12/19/17, 4:29:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Why are we arguing with Ethan if he is gunna work.
[12/19/17, 4:29:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why is cam saying anything if he isnt even in the same continent
[12/19/17, 4:29:38 PM] Dev Naik: Let’s find something a majority of us can do
[12/19/17, 4:29:40 PM] Chris Cheng: Ooh i like fireworks
[12/19/17, 4:29:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Wow u hella right
[12/19/17, 4:29:53 PM] Chris Cheng: We can just bring drinks to the place
[12/19/17, 4:29:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: Im out ✌🏾
[12/19/17, 4:30:05 PM] Chris Cheng: Love u cam😘
[12/19/17, 4:30:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Another good idea
[12/19/17, 4:30:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: Love the fuck out you bitch
[12/19/17, 4:30:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Before I go hear me out
[12/19/17, 4:30:41 PM] Dev Naik: That’s not a great idea because as Tim mentioned earlier, not all of us have fakes
[12/19/17, 4:30:51 PM] Dev Naik: And drinking in the open is a terrible idea
[12/19/17, 4:30:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What does that matter. One person buys
[12/19/17, 4:31:02 PM] Chris Cheng: But there’s 200,000 other people there
[12/19/17, 4:31:09 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^
[12/19/17, 4:31:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: My old roomie Alex. Had a house in SF. I can ask if u guys can party there. U can turn up and pre game. Go to the fireworks. And go back. And u can invite biddies
[12/19/17, 4:31:17 PM] Owen Gilbert: I'm not saying I don't wanna do fireworks and the countdown in the city, it's just going there on Bart, not really drinking, being cold, and there's no way we are going to find a place in sf, so we'd have to go on the crowded as fuck Bart to go home which would suuuck
[12/19/17, 4:31:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: Has*
[12/19/17, 4:31:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It would be an experience, isnt that what you guys keep talking about
[12/19/17, 4:31:46 PM] Chris Cheng: That would be perfect
[12/19/17, 4:31:54 PM] Dev Naik: This could work
[12/19/17, 4:32:05 PM] Chris Cheng: Im glad Cam is saying stuff, even if he is on another continent
[12/19/17, 4:32:17 PM] Cameron Freeman: Thank you chris. I appreciate you
[12/19/17, 4:32:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hold my dick
[12/19/17, 4:32:43 PM] Dev Naik: Lol I mean he does know people in San Francisco
[12/19/17, 4:32:52 PM] Dev Naik: Well more than any of us
[12/19/17, 4:33:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: This is truuue
[12/19/17, 4:33:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I personally dont feel comfortable taking over someone’s house that I am not close to
[12/19/17, 4:33:21 PM] Dev Naik: Johns friends with him right?
[12/19/17, 4:33:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yee
[12/19/17, 4:33:28 PM] Cameron Freeman: And guess what
[12/19/17, 4:33:32 PM] Dev Naik: So we chillin
[12/19/17, 4:33:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hes from the bay
[12/19/17, 4:33:36 PM] Chris Cheng: What if he’s ok with it?
[12/19/17, 4:33:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: He came to mine last year
[12/19/17, 4:33:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hewill b there 😑🤔
[12/19/17, 4:33:57 PM] Dev Naik: And John said he was going to sf buddies if we go to Merced so this way everyone wins
[12/19/17, 4:34:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Is he throwing something or are you asking if we can be at his house?
[12/19/17, 4:34:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: I will strongly suggest he throw something 😂
[12/19/17, 4:34:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: I just texted him
[12/19/17, 4:34:35 PM] Chris Cheng: Lolol
[12/19/17, 4:34:39 PM] Owen Gilbert: Bruh
[12/19/17, 4:34:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: I was gana have my birthday at his place
[12/19/17, 4:34:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: If I couldn't at ale and Reyna
[12/19/17, 4:35:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: And more people would have come then
[12/19/17, 4:35:24 PM] Dev Naik: Lit, Cam let us know what he says
[12/19/17, 4:35:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: Rodger that
[12/19/17, 4:35:38 PM] Dev Naik: Hopefully he is down but if not what’s the backup plan?
[12/19/17, 4:36:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: John said he's going to sf? Where is he going? Lmao
[12/19/17, 4:36:23 PM] Dev Naik: Idk where he just said if we went to Merced then he would go to sf
[12/19/17, 4:36:44 PM] Dev Naik: I’m assuming he means Alex?
[12/19/17, 4:36:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: Well he has a plan 🤔😂
[12/19/17, 4:37:18 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I’m not going to spend New Years with Alex
[12/19/17, 4:37:19 PM] Dev Naik: Well that just assuming he does and also assuming he would let us join lol
[12/19/17, 4:37:27 PM] Dev Naik: Why?
[12/19/17, 4:37:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Because I don’t want to
[12/19/17, 4:37:54 PM] Dev Naik: Really...
[12/19/17, 4:37:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lol idk what's going on over there in San Jose but I'm so glad I'm not there
[12/19/17, 4:38:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: Wow 😂
[12/19/17, 4:39:41 PM] Cameron Freeman: Timmy &a Ethan Lol love you guys to death. My boys. My niggas. Y'all lame as shit Hahahaha. God damn. I can't do it anymore lol this really none of my business anyway sorry for trying to assist. Good luck boys. Whatever u do. Please fasho FaceTime me🙌🏾
[12/19/17, 4:40:11 PM] Owen Gilbert: Is that because it'd be with that group? Like Thomas and ali?
[12/19/17, 4:40:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How are we lame as shit for not wanting to do a sameold house party, especially at a house of someone I barely know
[12/19/17, 4:40:22 PM] Owen Gilbert: @tim
[12/19/17, 4:40:41 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's not why ur lame lol
[12/19/17, 4:40:50 PM] Dev Naik: But Ethan we are planning on doing more than that..
[12/19/17, 4:41:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah Ethan u shutdown everything else so that's kinda all u guys have now
[12/19/17, 4:41:15 PM] Dev Naik: I thought we were going to go around the city before and do that firework thing
[12/19/17, 4:41:27 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No I really don’t care. Thomas is cool and Ali is irrelevant and this point
[12/19/17, 4:41:36 PM] Dev Naik: Countdown* not firework
[12/19/17, 4:41:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: They are going to New York
[12/19/17, 4:41:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: So they aren't here
[12/19/17, 4:41:51 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya that doesn’t change anything
[12/19/17, 4:41:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: They aren't lame
[12/19/17, 4:42:07 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I don’t want to go to some random house party
[12/19/17, 4:42:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: How is that random
[12/19/17, 4:42:24 PM] Dev Naik: What do you want to do?
[12/19/17, 4:42:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's Alex. And you guys. And whoeve u guys invite lol
[12/19/17, 4:42:43 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I rather go to SF and hangout in the city and watch the fireworks at night
[12/19/17, 4:42:54 PM] Dev Naik: So we can do that as well
[12/19/17, 4:43:07 PM] Dev Naik: I’ve said this
[12/19/17, 4:43:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yo for those who want to party at a place or get air b n b or whatever just do that. And whoever doesn't want to do that and just wants to watch fireworks as if it was the 4th of July then let them do that. U guys don't all have to have a unanimous decision
[12/19/17, 4:43:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because that looks impossible
[12/19/17, 4:44:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because some people can't compromise
[12/19/17, 4:44:12 PM] Dev Naik: Ya but is rather be all together
[12/19/17, 4:44:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes that was a sub tweet @19256993963 and @15858201670
[12/19/17, 4:44:28 PM] Cameron Freeman: They are being too difficult
[12/19/17, 4:44:29 PM] Dev Naik: It would be more fun altogether
[12/19/17, 4:44:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Coming from the guy saying people’s ideas are lame, but has a zero chance of being there
[12/19/17, 4:44:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: Me being there is irrelevant
[12/19/17, 4:44:52 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I like how Cameron is talking for everyone else. How about we bet opinions from people who are actually going to be here
[12/19/17, 4:44:59 PM] Dev Naik: Ok fine I think some ideas are lame too
[12/19/17, 4:44:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: I still can give bomb ass advice
[12/19/17, 4:45:04 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I don’t care
[12/19/17, 4:45:11 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lol aight
[12/19/17, 4:45:42 PM] Dev Naik: Cam is just trying to help us find something cool and fun to don
[12/19/17, 4:45:45 PM] Chris Cheng: I like the idea of hanging in the city and watching fireworks. And then after, we can still drink becuz we have Alex’s house in our back pocket
[12/19/17, 4:45:57 PM] Dev Naik: Me too
[12/19/17, 4:45:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: False analogy falice how ever u spell it
[12/19/17, 4:46:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hey thanks neighbor
[12/19/17, 4:46:24 PM] Dev Naik: Lol no problem
[12/19/17, 4:47:35 PM] Dev Naik: And for those who want to get drinks and drink at the fireworks, we can still do that, in addition to going back to the party at Alex’s
[12/19/17, 4:47:58 PM] Chris Cheng: I can buy if people pay me
[12/19/17, 4:48:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeah except going to alex’s still doesnt sound like a good plan because I dont feel comfortable using someone else’s house as a venue
[12/19/17, 4:49:09 PM] Dev Naik: That’s what Airbnb is if you think about it
[12/19/17, 4:49:17 PM] Chris Cheng: It’s ok. I’ll buy drinks for him too
[12/19/17, 4:49:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But thats the intention of air bnb
[12/19/17, 4:49:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok. If not Alex’s house, who’s house can we go to?
[12/19/17, 4:49:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: U used mine as a venue 🤔
[12/19/17, 4:49:40 PM] Dev Naik: So think of Alex’s place as an Airbnb
[12/19/17, 4:49:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: We always use Owens 🤔🤔
[12/19/17, 4:49:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You invited us
[12/19/17, 4:49:50 PM] Dev Naik: No we can’t use Owens
[12/19/17, 4:49:52 PM] Cameron Freeman: And Alex will invite you
[12/19/17, 4:50:07 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not going to just say this is our land now
[12/19/17, 4:50:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Going to plant the seed in his head
[12/19/17, 4:50:26 PM] Owen Gilbert: I kinda agree with Ethan on that but if he is actually fine with it, I'd be down, just I don't want to force it on him that he has to have us over
[12/19/17, 4:50:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah no shit lol
[12/19/17, 4:50:49 PM] Dev Naik: Yes Owen but that’s why cam is checking and getting back to us
[12/19/17, 4:50:59 PM] Dev Naik: And that’s why I asked what out backup plan was
[12/19/17, 4:51:33 PM] Dev Naik: This is a valid question
[12/19/17, 4:51:43 PM] Dustin Bradley: Alright no need to bash cam common fam
[12/19/17, 4:52:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahahaha hey Dustin thanks bro
[12/19/17, 4:52:30 PM] Dustin Bradley: Gotchu fam
[12/19/17, 4:52:38 PM] Dev Naik: To be fair no one really bashed Cam lol
[12/19/17, 4:52:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: More the other way around
[12/19/17, 4:53:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: I feel bashed
[12/19/17, 4:53:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: Bashed af
[12/19/17, 4:53:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: LOL gtfo 😂
[12/19/17, 4:53:42 PM] Dev Naik: Lol I see your point but no, it’s just a discussion
[12/19/17, 4:54:14 PM] Dev Naik: And no Cam, they bring up valid points of us deciding because you won’t even be there
[12/19/17, 4:54:35 PM] Chris Cheng: So are we just waiting on Alex’s response to move forward?
[12/19/17, 4:54:42 PM] Dev Naik: But I appreciate and will continue to appreciate your input because I think it helps
[12/19/17, 4:54:55 PM] Dev Naik: We need a backup

[12/19/17, 4:56:27 PM] Chris Cheng: Lmao
[12/19/17, 4:56:32 PM] Chris Cheng: Cam replied to himself
[12/19/17, 4:56:41 PM] Dev Naik: But that’s a sausage fest

[12/19/17, 4:58:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: End of story
[12/19/17, 4:58:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Travis may disagree
[12/19/17, 4:58:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: But
[12/19/17, 4:59:04 PM] Dev Naik: What you mean?
[12/19/17, 4:59:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: WOW HE REALLY SAID THAT
[12/19/17, 4:59:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: yo i still can't believe he really gay
[12/19/17, 4:59:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: Wow
[12/19/17, 4:59:45 PM] Dev Naik: Why does that matter?
[12/19/17, 5:00:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: That hes gay?
[12/19/17, 5:00:40 PM] Dev Naik: Yes lol
[12/19/17, 5:01:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's like.  When you think when u joke about something .. but aren't really 100% serious but ur just joking but don't think it's actually a thing but then it ends up actually being a thing in general that's crazy
[12/19/17, 5:01:22 PM] Dev Naik: Like I mean in this conversation why does it matter haha
[12/19/17, 5:01:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because when I said this I thought After maybe everyone may not think that
[12/19/17, 5:02:08 PM] Dev Naik: That’s fair I guess
[12/19/17, 5:02:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: And then I thought about Travis and then I was like wow that's crazy it actually happened
[12/19/17, 5:02:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lmao It wasn't relevant at all my bad
[12/19/17, 5:02:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: ✌🏾
[12/19/17, 5:02:45 PM] Dev Naik: Lol its fine it doesn’t matter
[12/19/17, 5:02:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I kinda agree with Ethan. If we just going back to SJ, we just hanging out stuff does it matter who’s there other than us
[12/19/17, 5:04:13 PM] Dev Naik: What does everyone think?

[12/19/17, 5:07:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Personally, I love the idea of just going back to sj and just drinking beers and playing games with everyone
[12/19/17, 5:07:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait what’s the plan with going to SJ and shit

[12/19/17, 5:08:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Y'all sound like the little rascals
[12/19/17, 5:08:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Women haters
[12/19/17, 5:08:43 PM] Dev Naik: Hehehe
[12/19/17, 5:09:13 PM] Dev Naik: Hey a woman has the same rights as us to go to Ethan’s place
[12/19/17, 5:09:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Holy shit. No girls are banned in SJ. No more than 15-20 people. Does that sound good ethan?
[12/19/17, 5:09:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Hang out and drink if yall want. You guys asked for a house, we have one, but just no party
[12/19/17, 5:09:19 PM] Owen Gilbert: I just made a joke cause Ethan sounded like he just wanted the guys
[12/19/17, 5:09:47 PM] Dev Naik: Bruh I’m not being serious lol
[12/19/17, 5:09:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If you guys want a plus one, then by all means bring one, but no plus 3 plus 4
[12/19/17, 5:10:03 PM] Dev Naik: Why not a plus 2?
[12/19/17, 5:10:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Stfu
[12/19/17, 5:10:15 PM] Dustin Bradley: Hahahahha🤣

[12/19/17, 5:10:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Jesus. Ethan’s house Ethan’s rules.
[12/19/17, 5:10:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Just let it be.
[12/19/17, 5:10:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thank you
[12/19/17, 5:10:34 PM] Dev Naik: That a serious question
[12/19/17, 5:10:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: Fuck Ethan's couch
[12/19/17, 5:10:41 PM] Dustin Bradley: Guys respect Ethan’s wishes
[12/19/17, 5:10:53 PM] Dev Naik: I know no party but I’m asking if I can bring a couple people
[12/19/17, 5:11:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Who are you bringing
[12/19/17, 5:11:06 PM] Owen Gilbert: I didn't mean a party, you just shut me down when I said we would go back to your place, made it sound like you weren't gonna have us over
[12/19/17, 5:11:22 PM] Dev Naik: People
[12/19/17, 5:11:46 PM] Dev Naik: But guys this is a solid backup plan I guess
[12/19/17, 5:13:14 PM] Chris Cheng: My gf will be there. Im just worried she’ll feel out of place if there are no other girls besides her and Maddy
[12/19/17, 5:13:36 PM] Dev Naik: Seeeeeeeeeee exactly why there should be more girls!!
[12/19/17, 5:13:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nobody said no girls.
[12/19/17, 5:13:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ethan said plus one.
[12/19/17, 5:14:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If that’s his rule. We go by that rule.
[12/19/17, 5:14:22 PM] Dev Naik: Better question what’s the limit on people all together Ethan?
[12/19/17, 5:14:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: If that's his rule then find another place 😂😂why u guys settling
[12/19/17, 5:14:39 PM] Owen Gilbert: SO, IF Alex's place is a thing, maybe go there earlier, drink a little, go out to sf streets, watch the countdown and fireworks, and again if Alex's place is a thing, go back to his place to chill/party, if Alex's place isn't a thing, we can just head to sf, so the countdown and fireworks, and then take caltrain back to Ethan to chill. Does that sound like the plan????
[12/19/17, 5:14:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Do we have another place?
[12/19/17, 5:14:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That sounds like a great plan.
[12/19/17, 5:15:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: You can if u look for one
[12/19/17, 5:15:10 PM] Dev Naik: But not everyone can bring someone
[12/19/17, 5:15:10 PM] Chris Cheng: 👍
[12/19/17, 5:15:32 PM] Dev Naik: Yes I guess so Owen
[12/19/17, 5:15:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If Alex’s place isn’t a thing, we can just roam sf and do whatever. And go to SF after
[12/19/17, 5:15:58 PM] Dev Naik: Sf or sj?
[12/19/17, 5:16:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sj*
[12/19/17, 5:16:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sorry
[12/19/17, 5:16:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Does it matter if they don’t bring someone.
[12/19/17, 5:16:19 PM] Dev Naik: Ok that’s why I thought just making sure
[12/19/17, 5:16:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's so late why u guys still awake
[12/19/17, 5:16:56 PM] Dev Naik: Yes because if not everyone can bring a girl then it will still be a sausage fest
[12/19/17, 5:17:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I probably won’t bring someone so does it matter?
[12/19/17, 5:17:16 PM] Dev Naik: And then Chris’s gf will feel out of place
[12/19/17, 5:17:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Then what’s your suggestion
[12/19/17, 5:17:37 PM] Dev Naik: Not limit ourselves
[12/19/17, 5:17:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yo chill guys invite like some strippers or something
[12/19/17, 5:18:03 PM] Dev Naik: To be fair that’s not limiting ourselves😂
[12/19/17, 5:18:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Not to limit ourselves to what?
[12/19/17, 5:18:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How will chris’ gf be out of place
[12/19/17, 5:18:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Where do you think mine will be?
[12/19/17, 5:18:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^^
[12/19/17, 5:18:37 PM] Dev Naik: Hey Chris said it
[12/19/17, 5:18:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I understand if she feels out of place.
[12/19/17, 5:18:46 PM] Dev Naik: I was just restating what he said
[12/19/17, 5:18:47 PM] Chris Cheng: I said both ours
[12/19/17, 5:18:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So invite some girls
[12/19/17, 5:18:57 PM] Dev Naik: Yes I meant both of yours
[12/19/17, 5:19:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: I have a phone number to this one stripper fromSF and she got hella friends
[12/19/17, 5:19:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: They not cheap doe
[12/19/17, 5:19:33 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Maddie loves just hanging with the guys. Maybe yvette is different idk
[12/19/17, 5:19:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What’s the issue with inviting a plus one. Who is a girl. I’m sure that would be fine.
[12/19/17, 5:19:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Seriously
[12/19/17, 5:20:00 PM] Chris Cheng: Yvette will be ok with it. She just likes having girls to talk to also
[12/19/17, 5:20:04 PM] Dev Naik: Who lol the only girls we know who are available are prob in Pleasanton
[12/19/17, 5:20:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: Victoria doesn't have any plans we were snapping today
[12/19/17, 5:20:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: She can bring her lady friends
[12/19/17, 5:20:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Boom
[12/19/17, 5:20:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright then you are saying why limit ourselves. Who were you gunna not limit yourself to and invite Dev?
[12/19/17, 5:20:52 PM] Cameron Freeman: Strippers
[12/19/17, 5:21:05 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly
[12/19/17, 5:21:07 PM] Dev Naik: Lol jk
[12/19/17, 5:21:36 PM] Dev Naik: Idk Mohit, that’s why we should go to a small party or try to get some place to have a small party
[12/19/17, 5:21:46 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok. What place?
[12/19/17, 5:21:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Other than Alex’s place.
[12/19/17, 5:22:10 PM] Dev Naik: That’s what we need to find, but we are settling rather than finding
[12/19/17, 5:22:18 PM] Cameron Freeman: Iv been living here as a fugitive for 8 days
[12/19/17, 5:22:21 PM] Cameron Freeman: Illegally
[12/19/17, 5:22:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: Feels good
[12/19/17, 5:22:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not gana lie
[12/19/17, 5:23:02 PM] Dev Naik: Lol Cam
[12/19/17, 5:23:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok then fucking name something. Ethan is being dope and offering his house. And he has rules. Because he doesn’t want a house party there.
[12/19/17, 5:23:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like jesus. It’s just the same loop over and over dawg.
[12/19/17, 5:23:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: No planning happening.
[12/19/17, 5:23:37 PM] Dev Naik: Airbnb
[12/19/17, 5:24:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok. Where.
[12/19/17, 5:24:23 PM] Dev Naik: I’m not saying Ethan isn’t being dope by offering his place
[12/19/17, 5:24:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I know.
[12/19/17, 5:24:37 PM] Dev Naik: That’s what we need to look for and research
[12/19/17, 5:24:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: I am 🙋🏾‍♂
[12/19/17, 5:25:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Never going to your place again
[12/19/17, 5:25:09 PM] Owen Gilbert: I'd rather do Ethans with chilling, free, rather than find a place that isn't booked or really shitty and pay for it
[12/19/17, 5:25:13 PM] Dev Naik: Somewhere in like Sausalito or something idk help me think
[12/19/17, 5:25:22 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Eyyyy
[12/19/17, 5:25:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lol I don't have a place so jokes on you 😂😂😂
[12/19/17, 5:25:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m down.
[12/19/17, 5:25:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: This way also is cheap as fuck
[12/19/17, 5:25:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And we can do whatever. And have a kickback
[12/19/17, 5:25:45 PM] Dev Naik: But the issue is how many people we can have
[12/19/17, 5:25:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: It's not booked because you haven't booked it and how u know it's shitty
[12/19/17, 5:26:13 PM] Owen Gilbert: If it's the guys, plus everyone's plus 1 or maybe 2, that should be fine bro lol
[12/19/17, 5:26:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Okay. Dev. EVERYONE pretty much is chill with having a kickback with the group and everyone has plus one. You’re the only one.
[12/19/17, 5:26:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: U guys can have a kick back whenever. ITS NEW YEARS EVE
[12/19/17, 5:26:43 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly
[12/19/17, 5:26:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cameron hold up bruh. I understand you’re trying to help and you are actually helping.
[12/19/17, 5:26:52 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m down for Ethan’s place we all are being to greedy and not seeing the bigger picture
[12/19/17, 5:27:18 PM] Dev Naik: I’m not opposed to a kickback, I’m just trying to see if we can find something that’s not a kickback on New Years
[12/19/17, 5:27:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok. Let us at least plan our first plan of Ethan’s house
[12/19/17, 5:27:44 PM] Owen Gilbert: No airbnb, too much of a hassle man
[12/19/17, 5:27:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: Cojo
[12/19/17, 5:27:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Then figure out another plan if we can think of
[12/19/17, 5:27:55 PM] Dev Naik: And Mohit not everyone has responded
[12/19/17, 5:28:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Almost everyone responded.

[12/19/17, 5:31:01 PM] Dev Naik: I’m sure they are too but can’t assume their answers
[12/19/17, 5:31:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course I can’t.
[12/19/17, 5:31:18 PM] Dev Naik: But you did?
[12/19/17, 5:31:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: How can you assume they wouldn’t be down tho
[12/19/17, 5:31:37 PM] Dev Naik: I never said they wouldn’t
[12/19/17, 5:31:44 PM] Chris Cheng: All we have to pay for is booze
[12/19/17, 5:32:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dev I swear figure out a plan for everyone to agree with and we gunna plan SJ. Cool? Alright. It’s good.
[12/19/17, 5:32:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright.

[12/19/17, 5:32:53 PM] Dev Naik: Aight thanks much appreciated y’all I’m just trying to help... was never opposed to Ethan’s place
[12/19/17, 5:32:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: To go to SJ from SF
[12/19/17, 5:33:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dawg. You are trying to help. But you are just being frustrating
[12/19/17, 5:33:22 PM] Dev Naik: And you aren’t lol?
[12/19/17, 5:33:38 PM] Dev Naik: Everyone is being frustrating including my self
[12/19/17, 5:33:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m just trying to have at least one plan done. So we don’t have nothing
[12/19/17, 5:33:47 PM] Dev Naik: We have one plan done
[12/19/17, 5:34:07 PM] Dustin Bradley: GUYS!!! CHILL this is family friendly only
[12/19/17, 5:34:08 PM] Dev Naik: But not everyone has responded to it yet
[12/19/17, 5:34:26 PM] Dev Naik: And Ethan’s place is kind of planned
[12/19/17, 5:34:52 PM] Dev Naik: What part of this isn’t lol?
[12/19/17, 5:35:13 PM] Owen Gilbert: Maybe like an hour or something, like after the countdown and fireworks we could just walk around for a bit and then do caltrain, just gotta see how we gonna handle the crowds when it comes to leaving sf
[12/19/17, 5:35:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright.
[12/19/17, 5:35:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That sounds good owen
[12/19/17, 5:37:04 PM] Dev Naik: Tbh going from sf to sj is going to be crazy
[12/19/17, 5:37:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Going from SF to anywhere is gunna be crazy though.
[12/19/17, 5:37:35 PM] Dev Naik: Unless we stay in sf
[12/19/17, 5:37:41 PM] Dev Naik: If we go there
[12/19/17, 5:37:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So an Airbnb?
[12/19/17, 5:38:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But is there any sorta affordable Airbnb’s there
[12/19/17, 5:38:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Are*
[12/19/17, 5:38:32 PM] Dev Naik: If we all split we can find something, with that being said I’d still rather not spend too much money
[12/19/17, 5:39:00 PM] Dev Naik: And Alex’s place is still a possibility
[12/19/17, 5:39:24 PM] Dev Naik: Unless you guys really don’t want to...
[12/19/17, 5:39:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ok. More people are cool with Ethan’s place than Alex’s place.
[12/19/17, 5:40:09 PM] Chris Cheng: I may drive to Ethan’s after SF. Becuz Yvette leaves later on New Years Day and i have to drive her to the airport
[12/19/17, 5:40:29 PM] Dev Naik: Alright.
[12/19/17, 5:41:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And is everyone down for splitting an Airbnb
[12/19/17, 5:42:41 PM] Owen Gilbert: I'm down, it's just going to be hard to find one that isn't booked, or is cheap enough that isn't small or shitty
[12/19/17, 5:42:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yo say what you want guys I'm being 100% when I say this and I would really appreciate if you all took this to heart and didn't clme up with a smart ass or calculated response. Really let it soak in. but from my point of view, we have so many available resource and options to what we can do. New Year's Eve isn't just any night. It's THE LAST night of a year. SO MANY MEMORIES happen from this night. It's an important ass night guys. ESPECISLLY for us. Because every year we go hard. And spend it together. Say what u want. But life is short. And we don't know where we will be next year. We don't know if any of us will still even be talking. We don't know if we will have the opportunity to even celebrate next year. This year. We are all together. We should cherish that. And being together isn't enough. Let's make major moves and fuck shit up. It's NEW YEARS EVE. From where I'm sitting. Seriously you guys are being LAZY and following whatever sounds easiest or less work. Even though u will have a good time drinking beers in San Jose, let's have a fucking GREAT time. Let's make this New Year's Eve the best we ever had and let's put forth energy and effort together to make it happen. We should not have to settle for less when we can have what we want. I love you guys and I gave up going to Prague for new years eve and spending New Years  in Europe because I wanted to be with my boys back home. I bought a fucking ticket to come home to spend Christmas with my ma and New Years with my boys. I could have got a return ticket for before New Years but I intentionally got it so we can make more memories and have a great fucking time. I wanted to surprise you guys and just show up but hopefully in me telling you I'm coming will encourage you to want to make this a more important night because it's not just any night.
[12/19/17, 5:44:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: That's why I'v been so invested in this because I'm not about to have a lame ass New Year's Eve when I could have having a lit ass time here
[12/19/17, 5:45:32 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But you wont be there 🤔
[12/19/17, 5:45:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: Nigga what
[12/19/17, 5:45:52 PM] Dev Naik: Hence why we should plan for something crazy haha! It was supposed to be a surprise..
[12/19/17, 5:46:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: I am coming home Sunday
[12/19/17, 5:46:06 PM] Dev Naik: I can’t tell if you are kidding or just can’t read

[12/24/17, 5:13:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: Looking through my notes and look what I found...

God 

3 teams
- the sac must be sacked a minimum of 3 times by a minimum of 2 people before one is able to catch the sac and throw the sac at a member of the other team.

-if a player catches the ball before a minimum of 3 (handjob) then that player must sit out and all of the players from the other teams come back in. If one of the players who just came in were to get out, the player who handjobed would be able to come back in.y

-if player A gets player B out. Player B can come back in when player A gets out. If player A gets player B, C, D, and any other players out, they would all come back in after player A is out.

- a sac cannot touch a hand before the minimum 3 is reached or the play is dead.

-once a player catches the sac they have 4 seconds to a. Throw the sac at an opponent, or b. Pass to a teammate. 

- teammates can pass to each other for a minimum of 2 times. 

- if a player catches a sac that is thrown at them they can now either a. Throw it back at an opponent, or throw it to a teammate with holding it a maximum of 4 seconds.

-If a sac is held longer than 4 seconds the play is ruled dead.

-once a player has caught the sac. If there are 9 opposing players than 3 people can touch the person with the sac and are deemed safe while that person has the Sac. If there are 8-6 opposing players then 2 people can touch the person with the sac and are deemed safe while that person has the sac. 5-3 opposing players then 1 person can touch the person with the sac and are deemed safe while that person has the sac. 2-1 players there are no touches to be deemed safe.

- if a player runs out of the boundary zone they are deemed out and are at the hand of whoever is holding the sac. When they person that was holding the sac gets out, that player who ran out of the boundary can return.

- if a player catches a sac and then ends up out of bounds they are safe and must return I'm bounds immediately.

- if a sac hits the ground and or the play is ruled dead a player can then exit the boundary. 

- when every member of a team is out. They can not come back in and are done.

-the game is over when members from one team are left. 

-if there are only two players from opposite teams still alive they must 1v1 and keep playing until only one team stands.

-if you are hit in the face you are safe and the play is deemed dead. 

- if a key whole occurs you lose the privilege to touch the sac holder and gain safety when someone catches the sac the next time. You also must take of ur dominant shoe.

[12/30/17, 12:08:37 AM] Cameron Freeman: I’m driving
[12/30/17, 12:08:50 AM] Dev Naik: And I’ve got shotgun
[12/30/17, 12:12:45 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: For some reason I find the need to continue this, but I need to explain myself further because I feel some of you don’t understand. I absolutely want to spend time with you guys on new years, I would never “desert” you and if you think that then you need to stop taking this so personally. If I get off early enough, then I am going to make the effort to get there, but in the instance where I get off late, I am staying in San Jose. I made it clear that seeing the countdown was important to me from the beginning of when I brought up SF as an idea, so if I am going to be given the option between missing it or staying and finding one in SJ, then I am staying. The point of not wanting to go to Reyna’s is because that is what we do every year and I actually am adamant about doing something different and regardless, I wouldn’t spend the night there. I offered up my house in SJ as a place you guys can come to because I had a feeling I would miss all of the other stuff and I still want to hang out with yall. And yes, maddie being with me is important. She wont go to SF by herself, so she will stay in SJ if I don’t go, and it is a big deal that I am with her because of how important the day is for her. If you want to see this as being selfish and prioritzing my girlfriend, then by all means, think of it that way, but considering I was one of the people who pushed for SF from the start, you have to be insane to think I don’t want to be there.
[12/30/17, 12:14:24 AM] Frankie: I understand Ethan
[12/30/17, 12:14:56 AM] Frankie: I’m not a part of this really but I get what you mean
[12/30/17, 12:15:07 AM] Owen Gilbert: Thanks Ethan, now please everyone let him be lol, I don't want another 100 message discussion just let the guy be damn
[12/30/17, 12:15:16 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah fuck you bruh. I hate you. You can just teleport. All these excuses

[12/30/17, 12:16:02 AM] Dustin Bradley: Ethan I respect you bro you do you man
[12/30/17, 12:16:17 AM] Cameron Freeman: I guess I’m insane then. I’m over it and done after this but seriously if u wanted to come you’d come. Bottom line. All I see are excuses! But have fun in SJ
[12/30/17, 12:16:41 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ok that’s fine thanks for explaining yourself that’s all i can ask for

[12/30/17, 12:17:30 AM] Mohit Veligenti: If ya can’t make it it’s good. Chris didn’t make it last year because of SoCal. Same type of deal.
[12/30/17, 12:17:43 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cam it’s impossible to tell when your shift ends. Especially on New Years
[12/30/17, 12:17:43 AM] Dev Naik: I’m personally not upset with you or anything of the sort, and I know this would be insane but if it meant that much would you be willing to come after lmao?
[12/30/17, 12:17:58 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I see that as a valid excuse
[12/30/17, 12:18:19 AM] Dev Naik: Meant that much meaning the countdown
[12/30/17, 12:18:30 AM] Cameron Freeman: It doesn’t matter when it ends. If he wanted to come he’d come after.

[12/30/17, 12:23:46 AM] Dustin Bradley: ^^^
[12/30/17, 12:23:59 AM] Dev Naik: He’s just pushing for everyone to be together, because it means a great deal to him as it does to all of us

[12/30/17, 12:24:47 AM] Dev Naik: He dead ass spent money to come back because he wanted to... he didn’t have to he chose to
[12/30/17, 12:25:03 AM] Dev Naik: None of us went to go see him there
[12/30/17, 12:25:17 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I understand that and it’s a true point.
[12/30/17, 12:25:25 AM] Dev Naik: But the point is he is here now and wants the group to be together
[12/30/17, 12:25:28 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That’s is absolutely correct
[12/30/17, 12:25:43 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But there’s also no point in continuously just roasting Ethan trying to get him to come.

But I want to say thanks now. And mohit I agree with what you said with the rewind, and that's a big reason I took pics from everyone's Facebook and insta, everyone's kinda got their own life now, and as much as the rewind is just stuff that I've filmed through the year, thought I should include you guys in what you been up to. And everyone been doing pretty fucking good, even with the ups and downs. So again thank you all for everything. Cheers to a fucking amazing 2018
[1/1/18, 11:47:41 PM] Owen Gilbert: And also sidenote with the new years video, didn't get nearly as much footage as I did last year which is fine it's just going to be shorter, not 12 minutes lol.

[1/12/18, 11:55:15 AM] Mohit Veligenti: The foothill one has so much music potential
[1/12/18, 11:55:34 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But they couldn’t deliver

[1/12/18, 11:55:47 AM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s not HORRIBLE
[1/12/18, 11:55:52 AM] Cameron Freeman: i agree
[1/12/18, 11:56:08 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But like, they couldn’t even produce it right at all
[1/12/18, 11:56:10 AM] Cameron Freeman: but im proud of them
[1/12/18, 11:56:21 AM] Mohit Veligenti: And it says produced by “Freeza” I was like ehh
[1/12/18, 11:56:36 AM] Cameron Freeman: i TA'd for some of these lil niggas and them niggas rappin are my ken from the BSU so im a lil bias
[1/12/18, 11:56:37 AM] Mohit Veligenti: You got yourself a production name and shit but you’re shit at mixing and mastering
[1/12/18, 11:56:46 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah. The rapping was good
[1/12/18, 11:56:50 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Production was shit
[1/12/18, 11:56:55 AM] Mohit Veligenti: They got some bars
[1/12/18, 11:57:10 AM] Owen Gilbert: ^^
[1/12/18, 11:57:18 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Alright, our rappers did a halfass cover of The Race. Neither of the guys could stay on beat with their raps and the lyrics were trash. Also, the Foothill choir was tacky af and shouldnt have been in there. Also, Owen was right about the vocals being low. Decent to light 3
[1/12/18, 11:57:32 AM] Chase Larsen: The production and instrumentals could’ve been wayyy better
[1/12/18, 11:57:39 AM] Mohit Veligenti: That snare roll pissed me the fuck off
[1/12/18, 11:57:51 AM] Mohit Veligenti: It was 4 bar loops
[1/12/18, 11:57:54 AM] Mohit Veligenti: The entire thing
[1/12/18, 11:58:11 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I wanna say a 4 to maybe a 5 but not really a 5
[1/12/18, 11:58:19 AM] Mohit Veligenti: That choir was shit tho
[1/12/18, 11:58:28 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Holy shit they could’ve used that choir so well
[1/12/18, 11:58:28 AM] Chase Larsen: Yeah the choir was pretty bad as well. If you add a choir it’s needs to
Be strong
[1/12/18, 11:58:29 AM] Owen Gilbert: There was a part in foothills where the audio was super off from the guy too
[1/12/18, 11:58:33 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But they really shit the bed
[1/12/18, 11:58:54 AM] Cameron Freeman: Y’all tough cridicts damn these are our peoples guy

[1/12/18, 11:59:13 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Atleast they had rappers that actually go to Foothill
[1/12/18, 11:59:14 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: They had originality with theirs but god the vocals were bad. And the beat itself was bland. The alternating rappers made it somewhat interesting and they had some good bars at the end, but other than that the annoying autotune and shit vocals ruin the entire thing. And the third guy was irrelevant and didnt even end, it just stopped. Strong 2
[1/12/18, 12:00:27 PM] Owen Gilbert: Just sounds like they're doing it just because it's a tradition, like they have to, idk just feel like the school spirit is fading lol
[1/12/18, 12:00:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^
[1/12/18, 12:00:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[1/12/18, 12:01:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo Owen chase you and I should go back and be like yo we gunna help you produce and do all this shit for y’all
[1/12/18, 12:01:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You guys*
[1/12/18, 12:01:09 PM] Chase Larsen: I think that’s somewhat true but you can’t expect every class to do the same thing
[1/12/18, 12:01:19 PM] Chase Larsen: That’s boring
[1/12/18, 12:01:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Make that shit a master piece

[1/12/18, 12:02:34 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I thought foothills content was better than amadors. Foothill trashed amadors record and scoring where amador just making fun of blue and yellow

[1/25/18, 6:24:27 PM] Chris Cheng: Up to u guys
[1/25/18, 6:24:35 PM] Chris Cheng: Its hard tho
[1/25/18, 6:24:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol trying to get the free life
[1/25/18, 6:25:04 PM] Chris Cheng: 😂😂😂
[1/25/18, 6:25:14 PM] Chris Cheng: Gotta do whatcha gotta do
[1/25/18, 6:25:19 PM] Chase Larsen: Hey Chris my cousin played this and I helped him out we got to like Q8 it’s pretty fun but gets really hard
[1/25/18, 6:25:56 PM] Chase Larsen: Also one of the hosts is on impractical jokers
[1/25/18, 6:26:05 PM] Dev Naik: I’ll try it out seems fun lol trivia is hella fun
[1/25/18, 6:28:42 PM] Dev Naik: How does it work? Also do you get anything if I sign up lol
[1/25/18, 6:28:54 PM] Dev Naik: Cuz I just did using your referral thing
[1/25/18, 6:29:09 PM] Chase Larsen: So there’s two games everyday
[1/25/18, 6:29:29 PM] Chase Larsen: At a certain time and you just log on and it will start asking you questions
[1/25/18, 6:30:17 PM] Chase Larsen: And it’s like 10 questions and you have to get them all right. And if you get all the questions right the prize they say at the beginning gets split evenly between all the people who won as well
[1/25/18, 6:30:35 PM] Dev Naik: Woah cool
[1/25/18, 6:30:42 PM] Chase Larsen: So you could win like $2-50 depending on how many people win and what the prize is
[1/25/18, 6:30:51 PM] Dev Naik: That’s pretty cool
[1/25/18, 6:30:54 PM] Chase Larsen: Could potentially be more than $50
[1/25/18, 6:31:01 PM] Chase Larsen: But yeah that’s the basic idea
[1/25/18, 6:31:06 PM] Dev Naik: That’s sick!
[1/25/18, 6:31:56 PM] Chris Cheng: I get an extra life when u play ur first game

[1/25/18, 6:38:57 PM] Chris Cheng: 0 lol
[1/25/18, 6:39:05 PM] Chase Larsen: It’s hard
[1/25/18, 6:39:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Like the first questions are easy and then it gets really hard
[1/25/18, 6:40:12 PM] Dev Naik: Oh hahah
[1/25/18, 6:40:34 PM] Dev Naik: Chase, have you won with your cousin?
[1/25/18, 6:41:03 PM] Chase Larsen: No the farthest we got was Q8
[1/25/18, 6:41:19 PM] Dev Naik: No clue what that means
[1/25/18, 6:41:26 PM] Chase Larsen: Question 8
[1/25/18, 6:41:27 PM] Dev Naik: How far do you have to go?
[1/25/18, 6:41:32 PM] Dev Naik: Oh
[1/25/18, 6:41:33 PM] Chase Larsen: 10 questions
[1/25/18, 6:41:47 PM] Dev Naik: So you have to get all 10 right in order to win
[1/25/18, 6:41:52 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah
[1/25/18, 6:46:51 PM] Dev Naik: Fosho
[1/25/18, 6:47:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Okay no so its 12 questions
[1/25/18, 6:48:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They have a pot prize of $2500 most days and if you answer all 12 correctly then you split the pot
[1/25/18, 6:49:17 PM] Dev Naik: Lol aight

[1/29/18, 4:06:23 PM] Joe Stine: Pistons won blake is trash
[1/29/18, 4:06:32 PM] Joe Stine: I mean clippers
[1/29/18, 4:06:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Hell yeah they did
[1/29/18, 4:06:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Bradley and harris are good role players
[1/29/18, 4:07:05 PM] Joe Stine: Pistons trading for a center who cant post up lmao
[1/29/18, 4:07:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah but you guys gotta realize... that means the clippers whole team is role players
[1/29/18, 4:07:45 PM] Chase Larsen: When a team trades their offensive superstar it leaves a hole for a little bit in scoring
[1/29/18, 4:07:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Deandre
[1/29/18, 4:07:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Building around him
[1/29/18, 4:08:06 PM] Joe Stine: Austin rivers is the goat
[1/29/18, 4:08:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Rivers time
[1/29/18, 4:08:13 PM] Chase Larsen: Deandre is more of a rebounder, defender
[1/29/18, 4:08:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And thats why they got harris and bradley, both solid shooters
[1/29/18, 4:08:47 PM] Chase Larsen: He can score inside but now that Blake is gone teams can focus on Dandre in the post
[1/29/18, 4:08:55 PM] Chase Larsen: Deandre*
[1/29/18, 4:09:31 PM] Chase Larsen: And Bradley is a good passer and defender
[1/29/18, 4:09:43 PM] Chase Larsen: He’s alright at shooting
[1/29/18, 4:10:08 PM] Chase Larsen: Austin rivers is finally going to become the player he was destined to become
[2/4/18, 9:28:59 PM] Owen Gilbert: I was at work for the super bowl so I just saw on YouTube trending, movie trailers galore!! Han solo, infinity war, Jurassic world 2, and cloverfield tv show! All super dope

[2/4/18, 9:29:53 PM] Owen Gilbert: I'll have to check it out
[2/5/18, 1:49:29 PM] Owen Gilbert: So for some reason, critics are HATING cloverfield, has a 12% on rotten tomatoes and everyone is saying it's the worst movie ever. But I just watched it and I liked it lol, also the audience score on rotten tomatoes is at like 60%. Audience likes it, critics hate it, for some reason
[2/5/18, 2:06:05 PM] Chase Larsen: Hmm interesting
[2/6/18, 11:30:15 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Okay, so May will have Avengers, Han Solo, andddddddddd

[2/6/18, 11:31:42 AM] Chase Larsen: Wait solo isn’t coming out later in the year?
[2/6/18, 11:31:43 AM] Owen Gilbert: Great year for movies
[2/6/18, 11:32:10 AM] Chase Larsen: I thought that’s what Star Wars was doing with their episodes and stories
[2/6/18, 11:32:29 AM] Owen Gilbert: Not with solo apparently
[2/6/18, 11:32:38 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Solo is late may
[2/6/18, 11:32:45 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Great month for movies

[2/6/18, 11:33:09 AM] Chase Larsen: I’m excited for solo, I think Ron Howard is going to nail it
[2/6/18, 11:35:22 AM] Chase Larsen: Actually I need to see who is doing the score for this movie as well
[2/6/18, 11:35:30 AM] Chase Larsen: I hope its Giacchino
[2/6/18, 11:36:29 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I cant wait to see Donald

[2/6/18, 11:36:57 AM] Chase Larsen: It’s not Michael but it is one of my other favorite composers
[2/6/18, 11:37:08 AM] Chase Larsen: Heck yes they got John Powell
[2/6/18, 11:39:13 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: They should get Ramin Djawadi to score it
[2/6/18, 11:39:22 AM] Chase Larsen: Nah
[2/6/18, 11:39:33 AM] Chase Larsen: John Powell is great this score is going to be amazing
[2/6/18, 11:39:42 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Djawadi would be great
[2/6/18, 11:40:03 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I wish they kept John Williams for all of the movies
[2/6/18, 11:40:12 AM] Chase Larsen: Well technically they do Ethan
[2/6/18, 11:40:19 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I bet they tried to contact Han Zimmer but it went right to Christopher Nolan’s voicemail
[2/6/18, 11:40:22 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: But not as the main composer
[2/6/18, 11:40:27 AM] Chase Larsen: They say based off the original score of John Williams
[2/6/18, 11:40:30 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: This guy
[2/6/18, 11:41:07 AM] Chase Larsen: Yeah I know but as long as it keeps hints of John Williams I’m fine with other composers
[2/6/18, 11:41:32 AM] Chase Larsen: As much as I like Hans Zimmer I wouldn’t pick him to do a Star Wars movie
[2/6/18, 11:41:43 AM] Chase Larsen: But I still think his scores are amazing
[2/6/18, 11:42:49 AM] Dustin Bradley: I think chase Larson should score the movie 🎥
[2/6/18, 11:43:02 AM] Dustin Bradley: Number one pick

[2/14/18, 12:56:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hey that’s a quote
[2/14/18, 12:56:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Shooting in florida at a high school. Currently going on
[2/14/18, 12:56:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah and that’s @john lol
[2/14/18, 12:57:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Wtf
[2/14/18, 12:57:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ofcourse
[2/14/18, 1:00:11 PM] Chase Larsen: They haven’t caught the shooter yet
[2/14/18, 1:02:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They just detained someone matching the description
[2/14/18, 1:03:13 PM] Chase Larsen: Ok hopefully it’s him and they get everything under control
[2/14/18, 1:03:20 PM] Chase Larsen: I saw something that said 20 injured
[2/14/18, 1:03:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Seen that. No fatalities confirmed
[2/14/18, 1:03:46 PM] Chase Larsen: That’s good
[2/14/18, 1:04:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: The fact there’s another shooting in the US is a fatality
[2/14/18, 1:05:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: The Americans here are going to get so much shit when everyone finds out about guns and how their country doesn’t have them etc 😑
[2/14/18, 1:06:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Isn’t it like the 17th school shooting of this year?
[2/14/18, 1:06:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: This is just one that’s publicized a lot
[2/14/18, 1:11:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Smh
[2/14/18, 1:13:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Suspect in custody
[2/14/18, 1:17:20 PM] Owen Gilbert: Still no deaths?
[2/14/18, 1:17:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: None confirmed yet
[2/14/18, 1:18:14 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I stopped watching the stream. Cbs news is showing a live stream right now and they showed a video of a kid in a class and it was hard to watch
[2/14/18, 1:26:56 PM] John Dong: Thanks @Owen📸 @Chris Cheng @19256991334 @19259180102

[2/14/18, 1:59:31 PM] Chase Larsen: That’s what I’m seeing
[2/14/18, 2:00:56 PM] Owen Gilbert: Just saying multiple fatalities
[2/14/18, 2:01:04 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah
[2/14/18, 2:02:14 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Oh so no deaths confirmed still
[2/14/18, 2:02:55 PM] Chase Larsen: No they said there are some fatalities
[2/14/18, 2:03:10 PM] Chase Larsen: Sheriff said that
[2/14/18, 2:03:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No numbers though i mean
[2/14/18, 2:03:37 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah no numbers
[2/14/18, 2:03:42 PM] Owen Gilbert: Ya I read victims as deaths
‎[2/14/18, 2:04:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ‎image omitted
[2/14/18, 2:35:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: 1 confirmed death. Shooter was 18 and not a student
[2/14/18, 2:36:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Pray no one says any bullshit like Valentine’s Day massacre
[2/14/18, 2:36:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Oh they will
[2/14/18, 2:37:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like don’t give a name to the bs
[2/14/18, 2:40:17 PM] Cameron Freeman: He was white hu
[2/14/18, 2:58:17 PM] Owen Gilbert: 2 now
[2/14/18, 3:29:29 PM] Dustin Bradley: 17 dead now it was a former student
[2/14/18, 3:29:52 PM] Chris Cheng: 17 already?
[2/14/18, 3:29:54 PM] Chris Cheng: Damn bro
[2/14/18, 3:30:08 PM] Dustin Bradley: I believe shooting took place in the freshmen hall correct me if I’m wrong anyone
[2/14/18, 3:30:40 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ya man it’s really sad

[2/14/18, 3:39:14 PM] Dustin Bradley: Yes! guys this is the 18th time a school shooting has happening since the start of the new year
[2/14/18, 3:39:26 PM] Dustin Bradley: Wth
[2/14/18, 3:41:16 PM] Owen Gilbert: Good that he's alive, I hate when they kill themselves or get killed. Now he can rot in a prison for the rest of his life
[2/14/18, 3:49:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I find it interesting to hear their motives, if they die we wont know
[2/14/18, 3:52:42 PM] Chris Cheng: Yea same
[2/14/18, 4:18:58 PM] Owen Gilbert: The fuck, they said he's been showing signs for years, has an Instagram dedicated to knifes and guns and when we attended the school he wasn't allowed on campus with a backpack on him..
[2/14/18, 4:20:01 PM] Owen Gilbert: He threatened students too when he attended
[2/14/18, 4:20:29 PM] Owen Gilbert: All the students said, "we predicted he was the one that did it"
[2/14/18, 4:20:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats probably why he was expelled
[2/14/18, 5:01:10 PM] Dustin Bradley: Sorry 8 not 18

[2/14/18, 7:11:00 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Every month should be black history month
[2/14/18, 7:11:17 PM] Chase Larsen: You know how Morgan freeman feels about black history month...
[2/14/18, 7:11:24 PM] Dev Naik: RT white people get every other month lol....
[2/14/18, 7:11:36 PM] Dev Naik: Should be the entire year
[2/14/18, 7:11:40 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That’s not true
[2/14/18, 7:11:47 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: There’s Asian history month
[2/14/18, 7:11:53 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Latino history month
[2/14/18, 7:12:20 PM] Dev Naik: But what are they overlooked by? Even black history month gets looked over
[2/14/18, 7:12:22 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Than the other months are just called by their names
[2/14/18, 7:12:56 PM] Dev Naik: Every month is over looked
[2/14/18, 7:13:09 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Well Latino history month is overlooked by 4th of July and Asian history month is overlooked by Corgi day
[2/14/18, 7:13:18 PM] Dev Naik: Hahahahaha
[2/14/18, 7:13:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Obviously
[2/14/18, 7:14:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin fuck you for sending that

[2/14/18, 7:41:04 PM] Dustin Bradley: Thanks for the love guys
[2/14/18, 9:35:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its not that black people get a single month. Its a month for empowering the culture. White people dont have a white month because who cares. Its a black pride, not “here black people you get a month”
[2/14/18, 9:45:03 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well put Ethan I feel like I get smarter each time you talk it’s very empowering I thank you humbly 🙏🏻

[2/14/18, 10:15:01 PM] Dustin Bradley: It’s probably not that much I assume
[2/14/18, 10:16:58 PM] Dustin Bradley: Yes I just leveled up only strength spells and sword skills that’s it the rest were ZERO because I didn’t give five fuck sticks
[2/14/18, 10:17:22 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So the answer is no you didnt play. Normie

[2/19/18, 9:35:54 AM] Chase Larsen: I know I’m late but I just saw the national anthem before the all star game, what was Fergie doing? Hahah
[2/19/18, 9:37:12 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I didnt want to watch it because of the backlash
[2/19/18, 9:37:59 AM] Chase Larsen: Hahah I mean it was mostly just her trying to do some runs or licks with her voice that didn’t go so well
[2/19/18, 9:40:51 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats what i heard
[2/19/18, 9:45:56 AM] Chase Larsen: And from previous messages it looks like the halftime show wasn’t good either haha

[5/12/18, 12:09:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Damn that actually is true
[5/12/18, 12:11:15 PM] Dev Naik: Well on one side it gets people to think more consciously and make it easier to become more progressive from there
[5/12/18, 12:11:40 PM] Frankie: Say what you want lol we all friends here
[5/12/18, 12:11:47 PM] Dev Naik: Facts lol
[5/12/18, 12:12:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think words shouldn’t be used as discriminatory, but if there is no malice behind the words, then it is just words
[5/12/18, 12:12:23 PM] Dev Naik: I agree, 100%
[5/12/18, 12:15:13 PM] Frankie: I meant more like everyone here is chill and we aren’t gonna freak bout it
[5/12/18, 12:15:20 PM] Frankie: Obviously depending on the company it changes
[5/12/18, 12:15:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Context makes difference
[5/12/18, 12:15:58 PM] Dev Naik: Yups
[5/12/18, 12:17:37 PM] Dev Naik: But all together it’s like breaking a bad habit. If you stop saying it all together you are less likely to say it in a discriminatory way
[5/12/18, 12:18:39 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ttttttrrrrrueeeeeeeee
[5/12/18, 12:19:10 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Sure I agree, but that’s just free will. Wether you chose to do so or not should not be required of you

[5/12/18, 12:20:10 PM] Dustin Bradley: Jk love = peace
[5/12/18, 12:20:32 PM] Dev Naik: Ya that’s fair, but I’d say under limitation
[5/12/18, 12:21:08 PM] Dev Naik: Of course if it’s discriminatory then it shouldn’t be allowed. It’s all about context
[5/12/18, 12:21:32 PM] Frankie: I’m going to hurt you
[5/12/18, 12:21:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I mean, you could do it, but you can’t do it and not expect backlash
[5/12/18, 12:22:23 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya your are responsible for the consequences of your words
[5/12/18, 12:22:23 PM] Dev Naik: Yes but why not try to stop it at the source of the issue
[5/12/18, 12:23:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: Then why do it when there’s so many other words you can use? Lack of vocabulary perhaps?
[5/12/18, 12:25:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Absolutely
[5/12/18, 12:25:51 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I agree you can use any words you want that’s your freedoms of choice. That’s what is important. That you have the freedom to say what you want to say.
[5/12/18, 12:26:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lack of vocabulary, poor upbringing, some people can’t change their lifestyles and some lifestyles include discriminatory language
[5/12/18, 12:26:34 PM] Dev Naik: I agree that you can use word as long as you aren’t personally attacking any person or group of people
[5/12/18, 12:27:09 PM] Dev Naik: Ya that fair but shouldn’t we change as people as time change as well
[5/12/18, 12:27:20 PM] Dev Naik: We need to learn from our past, not live in it
[5/12/18, 12:27:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You can only change so many people, not everyone will change
[5/12/18, 12:27:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: You can say whatever you want, but there you can also technically do whatever you want. I could stab the person in front if me, but there are consequences, and instead I could just hug them. Like you could just use a different word.  There’s a lot of things we can do but don’t because of how it affects others
[5/12/18, 12:27:55 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I agree to an extent at that
[5/12/18, 12:28:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think everyone is on the same page
[5/12/18, 12:28:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: I disagree
[5/12/18, 12:28:39 PM] Dev Naik: I know not everyone will change but the fact of the matter is we need to aleast make an attempt
[5/12/18, 12:28:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: Dustin stfu
[5/12/18, 12:28:45 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Yes I agree. Your actions have consequences and our will face those consequences under the law

[5/12/18, 12:29:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: He was typing LOL
[5/12/18, 12:29:52 PM] Frankie: Lol I thought Dustin was funny
[5/12/18, 12:30:34 PM] Dev Naik: 🙄😂
[5/12/18, 12:31:41 PM] Dustin Bradley: Here’s some words for thought. Just because your vocabulary is more advanced and larger than others does not mean you are better. I agree with Ethan and Tim words are just words they don’t mean anything unless the individual puts action behind its meaning
[5/12/18, 12:32:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly
[5/12/18, 12:32:14 PM] Jonathan Ong: Bravo Dustin 👏👏
[5/12/18, 12:32:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: No one said anyone was better than anyone. and words 100% mean things regardless of action
[5/12/18, 12:32:46 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No words mean nothing without context
[5/12/18, 12:32:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not true
[5/12/18, 12:32:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Can people call people a bitch as a sign of affection?
[5/12/18, 12:32:55 PM] Dev Naik: I don’t think anyone is fighting against that first part Dustin, word can be just words but with context it changes so much
[5/12/18, 12:33:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ethan your fat
[5/12/18, 12:33:16 PM] Cameron Freeman: That means you are fat
[5/12/18, 12:33:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: I have done no action
[5/12/18, 12:33:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: I mean you are fat
[5/12/18, 12:33:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: (You aren’t fat) but my words meant you were
[5/12/18, 12:33:35 PM] Dev Naik: But he isn’t fat
[5/12/18, 12:33:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That is not what was meant

[5/12/18, 12:33:59 PM] Dev Naik: LMAO
[5/12/18, 12:34:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: Okay we done here
[5/12/18, 12:34:11 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ignorance
[5/12/18, 12:34:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You are my bitch vs you are a bitch
[5/12/18, 12:34:17 PM] Dustin Bradley: Hahahahah
[5/12/18, 12:34:45 PM] Dev Naik: But that makes the person still a bitch either way
[5/12/18, 12:34:55 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I thought we were having a very productive discourse
[5/12/18, 12:35:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But it is only negative in a certain connotation
[5/12/18, 12:35:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The word itself is not negative on its own
[5/12/18, 12:35:33 PM] Dev Naik: I can agree to that
[5/12/18, 12:35:41 PM] Dev Naik: It really depends on the way people say things
[5/12/18, 12:36:04 PM] Dev Naik: Also Let’s go Danny hoesen!!
[5/12/18, 12:36:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just saw that
[5/12/18, 12:36:27 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I agree as well. That’s why our language is so complex
[5/12/18, 12:36:27 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao
[5/12/18, 12:37:18 PM] Frankie: Imma be honest with you guys I use derogatory terms occasionally but always in a humorous manner not like insulting
[5/12/18, 12:37:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Well it was fun while it lasted. I learned a lot and I thought Dev brought up a lot of strong and valid arguments
[5/12/18, 12:38:00 PM] Dev Naik: Yups, with that being said, most people use certain words in a negative context which attack people and groups of people which creates some mucky water on whether it should be said in general
[5/12/18, 12:38:10 PM] Dustin Bradley: Cam it not the word fat itself it’s your body language thats an action. If I call you fat my body will unconsciously show that I’m being serious
[5/12/18, 12:38:28 PM] Dustin Bradley: And yes context also plays a big role
[5/12/18, 12:38:39 PM] Dev Naik: It was fun and I also thought Tim brought some insightful ideas to the table

[5/12/18, 12:40:05 PM] Dev Naik: Lol Tim
[5/12/18, 12:40:08 PM] Frankie: Nah I’d have to say it’s the meaning behind what you’re saying
[5/12/18, 12:40:12 PM] Frankie: Lmao
[5/12/18, 12:40:30 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I’m not going to open any Facebook links. I apologize for the inconvenience
[5/12/18, 12:41:01 PM] Dev Naik: I was just responding to what Dustin said
[5/12/18, 12:41:02 PM] Dustin Bradley: No what I’m saying is our bodies have a natural inclination to show how we actually feel without us really knowing we are doing it
[5/12/18, 12:41:07 PM] Jonathan Ong: At the end of the day words are just words. Unless they are directly inciting violence against another party or if it’s directly threatening another person, it is protected and allowed in this country. There will always be people who make derogatory statements or use “offensive” language, and that’s ok. They will just have to deal with the consequences that society punishes them with
[5/12/18, 12:41:21 PM] Dev Naik: So words have meaning to them and themselves are action
[5/12/18, 12:42:15 PM] Dustin Bradley: And that’s through body language witch is another form of human communication and I would say it’s one of the most important
[5/12/18, 12:42:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Have any of you ever misread a text? Thinking it was meant one way but it was actually meant another?
[5/12/18, 12:43:44 PM] Dev Naik: But the other issue is that those people who say these thing and do face the societal punishments, then say they are being threatened for something they believe isn’t wrong
[5/12/18, 12:43:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dustin is right by saying body language is important. Human language is so complex that the words themselves, in the written form, have little meaning
[5/12/18, 12:44:13 PM] Dev Naik: Also Wondo!!!
[5/12/18, 12:44:37 PM] Frankie: It’s Tom Holland dancing to umbrella by Rihanna
[5/12/18, 12:44:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What the fuck is happening
[5/12/18, 12:44:53 PM] Dev Naik: Yes but if words bring out body language then those words are directly related with those feeling
[5/12/18, 12:45:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Everyone’s arguing something completely different than what we are even saying and sounding like dumb dumbs
[5/12/18, 12:45:07 PM] Cameron Freeman: Mohit I miss y
[5/12/18, 12:45:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: U*
[5/12/18, 12:45:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They are absolutely related
[5/12/18, 12:45:23 PM] Cameron Freeman: Related maybe but not at all what we are saying
[5/12/18, 12:45:46 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think you are saying something different
[5/12/18, 12:45:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: My point is there are so many other words you can use other than the word he used.
[5/12/18, 12:46:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No one denied that
[5/12/18, 12:46:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: And then now idk what direction we went in
[5/12/18, 12:46:33 PM] Dev Naik: It just branched to a bigger discussion about today’s society
[5/12/18, 1:13:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Miss ya too buddy
[5/12/18, 12:48:17 PM] Frankie: It got a little to deep for me lmao
[5/12/18, 12:48:40 PM] Jonathan Ong: Well that’s their problem. Sometimes u can’t change how ppl think. And if they don’t align with societal norms, that’s their problem to deal with. There’s nothing, not a government nor some other entity, that can act as thought police gauging what someone believes to be right or wrong. There will always be ppl who think and say things that are  morally wrong, and there’s really nothing u can do about that. It’s just the world we live in
[5/12/18, 12:51:17 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: @19258955572 I think one of the best arguments for your pov is language used when your with family or little kids. Now we know not to swear in front of kids because they are impressionable and I know not to swear in front of my mom or she’s gonna beat my ass. Now I do have the right to say what I want but under those circumstances I’ll limit my freedom of speech to accommodate those I care about. But my free will still remains.
[5/12/18, 12:51:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: i.e. context matters
[5/12/18, 12:52:27 PM] Frankie: ^
[5/12/18, 12:54:57 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I agree there with you Cam and Dev that there is a problem but the solution is not censorship. It’s teaching. Teach our kids and ourselves the power behind words and language. The power is in the way you use them
[5/12/18, 12:55:24 PM] Dev Naik: I agree
[5/12/18, 12:55:35 PM] Dev Naik: The only way to move forward is teaching
[5/12/18, 12:56:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: 100% agree. Glad we on same page
[5/12/18, 12:57:42 PM] Dev Naik: I think everyone is on the same page about teaching being the way for change
[5/12/18, 12:58:08 PM] Frankie: Group hug?
[5/12/18, 12:58:24 PM] Dev Naik: 🤗
[5/12/18, 12:58:48 PM] Chase Larsen: I agree
[5/12/18, 12:58:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Here is an actual example I am dealing with. There is a “joke” now that someone in our fraternity has been doing by writing fake heart messages on our wall, and one of the hearts makes fun of a good friend of our house and her relationship with her boyfriend. As president, i had to ask them to remove it from the wall, but they are absolutely entitled to their ability to make that joke, however because of how poor taste it was and how public it is, my job becomes a bit of a censoring
[5/12/18, 12:59:31 PM] Frankie: Well I mean if it’s targeting someone it’s more of an attack on them than free speech
[5/12/18, 12:59:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Exactly why I have to censor
[5/12/18, 1:00:09 PM] Frankie: I agree with that decision Mr president
[5/12/18, 1:00:15 PM] Dev Naik: Yes!
[5/12/18, 1:00:31 PM] Dev Naik: Each situation asks for different circumstances
[5/12/18, 1:00:52 PM] Frankie: Off topic but is everyone gonna be back for summer
[5/12/18, 1:01:00 PM] Chase Larsen: El presidente
[5/12/18, 1:01:03 PM] Dev Naik: Wait now everyone we do Mr. president get down it’s always going to be Ethan lol

[5/12/18, 1:01:49 PM] Dev Naik: I’ll be back
[5/12/18, 1:02:06 PM] Dev Naik: We are just protecting the president
[5/12/18, 1:02:09 PM] Frankie: Ah Jesus lmao I ain’t tackling you first
[5/12/18, 1:02:15 PM] Frankie: Send Dustin
[5/12/18, 1:02:19 PM] Chase Larsen: Dev when are you getting back?

[5/12/18, 1:03:02 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I just wanted to clarify what I mean by saying omegas are gay. I don’t think anyone would really get the context except maybe Ethan becuase it’s so math specific. I more or less made that comment about my frustration with the properties of omegas
[5/12/18, 1:04:24 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Just a bad joke for the wrong crowd lol
[5/12/18, 1:04:42 PM] Dev Naik: You were attacking omegas...

[5/12/18, 1:07:24 PM] Frankie: 🤔
[5/12/18, 1:07:27 PM] Chase Larsen: I censor out the nudity by watching it with Bryce and Dustin they tell me to turn away when those scenes come up
[5/12/18, 1:07:48 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: But those are the best parts!
[5/12/18, 1:07:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If this is true, this is fantastic

[5/12/18, 1:10:01 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I just wanted to say I’m really rejoiced that I can have a debate with you guys that is thought provoking and non-malicious. I think as a group we’ve come a long way to be able to accomplish this

[5/12/18, 1:10:40 PM] Chase Larsen: I agree Tim it’s good stuff

[5/14/18, 7:51:01 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Oh that’s what it is! The whole time I was watching I was thinking “this sounds a lot like Star Wars”
[5/14/18, 7:52:53 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I would have to say that’s what makes John Williams so great. I think it’s really cool when you can see where artists eat their inspirations from

[5/15/18, 5:22:08 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah and then I woke up and I wasn’t dizzy or anything. I was talking fine and I would never attempt to drive after but I told my mom that I felt normal hahah
[5/15/18, 5:22:37 PM] Chase Larsen: I don’t know what’s going on also the numbness is gone and I still don’t have pain its weird
[5/15/18, 5:23:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Just give it like a day or 2 lol
[5/15/18, 5:23:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It depends on your surgery
[5/15/18, 5:23:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If your teeth were REAAAALLY messed up and they had to drill and stuff. It’ll hurt when recovering. But it won’t too much if they just pulled me out
[5/15/18, 5:23:56 PM] Chase Larsen: Well from what I’ve heard it’s pretty bad like as soon as the numbness goes away but I feel fine and I don’t have much swelling at all as well
[5/15/18, 5:24:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh the swelling is at it’s worst day 3
[5/15/18, 5:24:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I had my pulled during spring break

[5/15/18, 5:24:45 PM] Chase Larsen: They gave me medication to help against the slowing
[5/15/18, 5:24:54 PM] Chase Larsen: Swelling*
[5/15/18, 5:24:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What did they give you?
[5/15/18, 5:25:27 PM] Chase Larsen: I forget the names but they actually gave me a pretty powerful pain med
[5/15/18, 5:25:32 PM] Chase Larsen: I’m not gonna use it

[5/15/18, 5:25:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Narcos
[5/15/18, 5:25:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Probably vicodin
[5/15/18, 5:26:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I said I have a low pain tolerance and they were like “oh you’ll be fine. Here’s some extra strength Motrin” lol
[5/15/18, 5:27:30 PM] Chase Larsen: Well how was your pain and were you loopy when they did yours
[5/15/18, 5:27:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dawg I was awake during mine lol

[5/15/18, 5:27:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Just numbed my mouth
[5/15/18, 5:27:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And they drilled my teeth out
[5/15/18, 5:28:11 PM] Chase Larsen: Hahah well bro I could see why yours is probably more painful
[5/15/18, 5:28:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And when that numbness ended. It just was PAINFUL for the first night
[5/15/18, 5:28:46 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Then the second day onward it was playing
[5/15/18, 5:28:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Okayish*
[5/15/18, 5:29:54 PM] Chase Larsen: Hmm interesting honestly I was expecting to just be dead today but I’ve been fine, I just finished a walk and I’ve been practicing piano and guitar.
[5/15/18, 5:30:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ya
[5/15/18, 5:30:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe you just have a high tolerance to pain 🤷🏽‍♂️
[5/15/18, 5:31:18 PM] Chase Larsen: I don’t know man maybe to drugs as well hahahah

[5/15/18, 5:32:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Chase, take one of those narcos and have a great rest of your life lol

[5/15/18, 5:32:35 PM] Chase Larsen: I’m sure that would do something but I’m not taking that
[5/15/18, 5:32:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^^^^^^^

[5/15/18, 5:33:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Unless you are taking more than they say to take
[5/15/18, 5:33:06 PM] Chase Larsen: Dude I try to never take medication
[5/15/18, 5:33:40 PM] Chase Larsen: They should make those
[5/15/18, 5:51:28 PM] Dev Naik: It really depends from person to person. Only one side of my face swelled up and it only hurt after I went to SF and walked around all day playing Pokémon go with people hahah...
[5/15/18, 5:52:07 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah that’s what I’ve heard

[6/5/18, 9:39:42 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Find a deal and send it here and we can all vote maybe?
[6/5/18, 9:57:12 AM] Bryce Olson: What kind of boat r u talking about Cam? Like a canoe or what? Cuz boats r a lot of money
[6/5/18, 9:58:51 AM] Cameron Freeman: A boat boat Bryce. They aren’t that expensive. There are a bunch of options on air b n b. When I have some down time I’ll show you. But for example we had an air b n b boat in Amsterdam and we will in a couple weeks and this one was like 20 each for 3 people so it would be cheap
[6/5/18, 9:59:15 AM] Joe Stine: Like a house boat on a lake or what?
[6/5/18, 9:59:31 AM] Cameron Freeman: On a house boat but like a bigger boat that will fit us
[6/5/18, 9:59:34 AM] Cameron Freeman: Nothing huge
[6/5/18, 9:59:37 AM] Cameron Freeman: But yeah in a lake
[6/5/18, 9:59:39 AM] Cameron Freeman: Or something
[6/5/18, 9:59:45 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Cameron, I think a canoe is big enough
[6/5/18, 9:59:54 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Like 2
[6/5/18, 10:00:03 AM] Mohit Veligenti: We good with that I think
[6/5/18, 10:00:11 AM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s perfect
[6/5/18, 10:00:16 AM] Joe Stine: I know you can rent a house boat at lake shasta for not too much, but idk if we'd be able to reserve one with such late notice.
[6/5/18, 10:00:17 AM] Cameron Freeman: Do we have different definitions on what canoes are or are u being funny lol
[6/5/18, 10:00:26 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m kidding lol
[6/5/18, 10:00:29 AM] Cameron Freeman: We have a whole month

[6/5/18, 10:00:47 AM] Joe Stine: Yeah people reserve them like 6 months in advance

[6/5/18, 10:00:59 AM] Joe Stine: I'll look
[6/5/18, 10:01:06 AM] Cameron Freeman: Sweet perfect
[6/5/18, 10:08:53 AM] Bryce Olson: Ok dope that’s make sense
[6/5/18, 11:34:43 PM] Joe Stine: I looked into the house boat thing and its gonna be expensive like 200-350 per person since were only booking one month in advance and its a holiday. Otherwise it wouldve been cheaper :/
[6/5/18, 11:41:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: Is it by head or is there a total number
[6/5/18, 11:42:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: But Forsure thanks for checking joe, I’ll check air b n b later
[6/5/18, 11:42:48 PM] Joe Stine: Total number. For example rent a 13 person boat, pay a flat rate.

I am not the best son.
I have missed some dates; This is Exhibit A.

I am not the best son.
I have argued little things; Means nothing end of day.

I am not the best son.
I have lied and hid facts; Tried to pull away.

I am not the best son.
I have tried to learn from you; You always push me the right way
[6/29/18, 11:13:29 PM] Dustin Bradley: I have no problem with it except for the fifth and six lines they don’t flow that well
[6/29/18, 11:14:18 PM] Dustin Bradley: But so far I think it looks okay just needs to be peer edited more
[6/29/18, 11:16:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ethan it’s good.
[6/29/18, 11:16:50 PM] Dev Naik: In terms of flow and repetition keep the syllables the same througout in the lines
[6/29/18, 11:17:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Take out always in the last one
[6/29/18, 11:18:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And put “I tried to pull away”
[6/29/18, 11:18:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That one was 5 syllables, but it needs to be 6
[6/29/18, 11:18:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^dev and I both read and figured this out
[6/29/18, 11:18:47 PM] Dev Naik: Yups keeping the syllables the same would make it flow nicer
[6/29/18, 11:20:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I never really proofed it myself so I probably could have picked that one out, but thanks
[6/29/18, 11:20:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: !

[6/29/18, 11:21:14 PM] Dev Naik: Some nice wood frame
[6/29/18, 11:21:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But add a picture of you guys, and then put a flower in it. Flattened
[6/29/18, 11:21:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And then sign it. Also handwritten
[6/29/18, 11:21:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I was thinking like a hallmark card with a photo in the middle
[6/29/18, 11:21:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I know you probably know these. Just throwing out idea
[6/29/18, 11:21:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah. Not hallmark
[6/29/18, 11:21:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Handwrite it.

[7/1/18, 5:44:09 PM] Chase Larsen: I find it hilarious that grown men cal people they don’t even know snakes hahaha
[7/1/18, 5:44:11 PM] Joe Stine: Lebron left a team where he promised to win a championship. He did. Then he leaves now because Cavs are trash and JR smith was the warriors mvp.
[7/1/18, 5:44:20 PM] Chase Larsen: Call*
[7/1/18, 5:44:47 PM] Joe Stine: KD is a 🐍

[7/1/18, 7:46:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: How does kawhi fit? Randle moves to 6th man?
[7/1/18, 7:46:59 PM] Chase Larsen: They should trade Ingram though

[7/1/18, 7:47:16 PM] Chase Larsen: Nah no kawhi

[7/1/18, 7:49:07 PM] Chase Larsen: Cousins on LA would actually make my day that team would be so interesting
[7/1/18, 7:49:14 PM] Chase Larsen: And I’m a kings fan hahah
[7/1/18, 7:49:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Why leave nola tho?
[7/1/18, 7:49:54 PM] Chase Larsen: Well he’s always had rumors to go to LA and most athletes like it there
[7/1/18, 7:50:16 PM] Chase Larsen: Also a chance to play with Lebron and get to the playoffs
[7/1/18, 7:50:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: Also when he was hurt they won and did great without him
[7/1/18, 7:50:36 PM] Chase Larsen: But I think he stays in nola
[7/1/18, 7:50:37 PM] Cameron Freeman: So Nola doesn’t need him

[7/1/18, 7:53:56 PM] Chase Larsen: I know I was just making a joke about the warriors
[7/1/18, 7:54:20 PM] Chase Larsen: But I think the lakers should trade away Thomas as well
[7/1/18, 7:55:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Bron just joined the Cavs of the West -Terrance Ross

[7/1/18, 8:11:19 PM] Chase Larsen: Well the spurs don’t want to give the lakers a great player right now
[7/1/18, 8:11:36 PM] Chase Larsen: But for sure he is going to be a laker in the future
[7/1/18, 8:19:07 PM] Chase Larsen: Now all the lakers have to do is sign liAngelo Ball

[7/2/18, 8:07:46 AM] Dev Naik: Neymar is awakening
[7/2/18, 8:24:26 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Neymar is a bitch
[7/2/18, 8:24:35 AM] Cameron Freeman: Rt
[7/2/18, 8:25:13 AM] Dev Naik: Lol he is so fragile and small haha
[7/2/18, 8:25:25 AM] Cameron Freeman: Wait no I like him
[7/2/18, 8:25:29 AM] Cameron Freeman: But I want mezico to win
[7/2/18, 8:25:51 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: He falls down and cries and make sure he rolls 10 ft every time he falls
[7/2/18, 8:26:13 AM] Dev Naik: He sells it yes, but he does get fouled every time
[7/2/18, 8:26:52 AM] Dev Naik: He is the most fouled player
[7/2/18, 8:26:57 AM] Dev Naik: Wow so dirty from Mexico
[7/2/18, 8:27:03 AM] Dev Naik: Should be a re d
[7/2/18, 8:27:06 AM] Dev Naik: Red*
[7/2/18, 8:27:09 AM] Cameron Freeman: Racist
[7/2/18, 8:27:13 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Gtfo
[7/2/18, 8:27:18 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: He barely touched him
[7/2/18, 8:27:27 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Barely tapped him
[7/2/18, 8:27:33 AM] Dev Naik: You can’t step on a down player lol
[7/2/18, 8:27:45 AM] Dev Naik: That is misconduct
[7/2/18, 8:28:27 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Look at Neymar flailing like a fish
[7/2/18, 8:28:30 AM] Dev Naik: Well maybe not red lol but at least a talking to but it’s unnecessary
[7/2/18, 8:28:41 AM] Dev Naik: That was completely unnecessary
[7/2/18, 8:29:05 AM] Dev Naik: Willian is doing well
[7/2/18, 8:29:53 AM] Dev Naik: Again yes he does but he gets fouled all the time...
[7/2/18, 8:30:27 AM] Dev Naik: Not saying he should flop cuz it pisses me off too but really does get fouled way too many times
[7/2/18, 8:36:25 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: He does get fouled but he also had a such a bitchy attitude when he does
[7/2/18, 8:36:40 AM] Dev Naik: Yes agreed
[7/2/18, 8:38:03 AM] Dev Naik: At least he gets fouled though unlike so many other players like robben... chicherito at times but mainly robben
[7/2/18, 8:39:00 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Can’t even put chichirito in the same criminal pool as robber and Neymar
[7/2/18, 8:39:21 AM] Dev Naik: Sure you could you see how many time I doesn’t get fouled and flops...
[7/2/18, 8:39:58 AM] Dev Naik: I’m talking strictly faking the foul
[7/2/18, 8:44:00 AM] Dev Naik: Let’s gooooooo
[7/2/18, 8:44:18 AM] Dev Naik: Firmino!!!
[7/2/18, 8:45:35 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Brazil v Belgium gonna be good
[7/2/18, 8:46:00 AM] Dev Naik: Lol facts but let’s go japan
[7/2/18, 8:47:26 AM] Dev Naik: Lol get up Neymar
[7/2/18, 8:49:33 AM] Dev Naik: Brasil’s defense is ridiculous this year... even without Marcelo and Alves...
[7/2/18, 8:51:03 AM] Dev Naik: Need Marcelo back if we play Belgium though... and it’s a huge loss to not have Casemiro...
[7/2/18, 8:51:59 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: It’s a huge loss to have a bitch like Neymar as the star of your nation
[7/2/18, 8:53:39 AM] Dev Naik: Unless you call scoring a goal and having an assist a loss I don’t know what you are talking about
[7/2/18, 8:54:08 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Of course not
[7/2/18, 8:54:16 AM] Dev Naik: He is a bitch that plays ridiculously well...
[7/2/18, 8:54:34 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: His assist was a shot
[7/2/18, 8:54:51 AM] Dev Naik: He is also a bitch who is one of the best in the world
[7/2/18, 8:54:51 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: And his goal was a tap in, I haven’t seen much talent from him this cup
[7/2/18, 8:55:16 AM] Dev Naik: He is also a bitch who is the third leading all time goal scorer for country
[7/2/18, 8:55:42 AM] Dev Naik: Have you seen his movement off the ball and ability to create plays and move around players
[7/2/18, 8:55:50 AM] Dev Naik: He opens up space for everyone else
[7/2/18, 8:55:56 AM] Dev Naik: This is true tho
[7/2/18, 8:56:35 AM] Dev Naik: 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾Ochoa🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
[7/2/18, 8:57:26 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its not anything spectacular. Layún worked him a couple times
[7/2/18, 8:57:34 AM] Dev Naik: By fouling him..
[7/2/18, 8:57:47 AM] Dev Naik: If it isn’t spectacular then how come it works??
[7/2/18, 8:58:09 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes he fouled him, and then cleanly stole the ball 3 of the next 4 attempts against him
[7/2/18, 8:58:21 AM] Dev Naik: He doesn’t get it 100% however he gets people frustrated
[7/2/18, 8:58:32 AM] Dev Naik: But what about the times he makes it past...
[7/2/18, 8:58:50 AM] Dev Naik: Who scored? Who made the better plays? Who came out on top?
[7/2/18, 8:59:27 AM] Dev Naik: Layun didn’t do much that game at all..
[7/2/18, 9:00:06 AM] Dev Naik: Working him a couple times compared to Neymar getting in his head and being able to work around him
[7/2/18, 9:01:40 AM] Dev Naik: Neymar is so good at getting into peoples heads, which is one reason he gets fouled, he has he ability to get around almost every player and make plays and scores goals
[7/2/18, 9:02:12 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Hey did you guys make that list for 4th by the way
[7/2/18, 9:02:20 AM] Dev Naik: Lol nope
[7/2/18, 9:02:26 AM] Dev Naik: I have my stuff tho
[7/2/18, 9:03:02 AM] Dev Naik: I got a couple bags of chips and a fat watermelon
[7/2/18, 9:04:16 AM] Dev Naik: And still am bringing the canopy and a small table thing along with a cooler if I can find it
[7/2/18, 9:11:43 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I was suggesting it so we can also give it to Jaron and the others coming in case we don’t have something they do
[7/2/18, 9:12:08 AM] Dev Naik: At that’s why I just put it on here for now
[7/2/18, 9:12:11 AM] Dev Naik: Ya*
[7/2/18, 12:05:51 PM] Dev Naik: Oh my word
[7/2/18, 12:07:35 PM] Joe Stine: Nani?
[7/2/18, 12:07:51 PM] Dev Naik: Japan is up lol
[7/2/18, 12:08:09 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Japan is playing perfectly
[7/2/18, 12:08:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That goal was a beaut
[7/2/18, 12:08:30 PM] Dev Naik: Seriously tho!
[7/2/18, 12:09:54 PM] Dev Naik: Holy shit
[7/2/18, 12:10:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Holy shit
[7/2/18, 12:10:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Holy shit
[7/2/18, 12:10:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Holy shit
[7/2/18, 12:10:31 PM] Dev Naik: Holy shit
[7/2/18, 12:10:32 PM] Joe Stine: Ez
[7/2/18, 12:10:54 PM] Dev Naik: Bruh.... this is insane
[7/2/18, 12:11:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo wtf is happening. There’s so much cheering happening in the office
[7/2/18, 12:12:08 PM] Dev Naik: Hahaha ya
[7/2/18, 12:13:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: They watching on the 80 inch TVs in the conference room going wild
[7/2/18, 12:14:02 PM] Dev Naik: You should watch lol
[7/2/18, 12:14:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m an intern trying to get hired back next year, you know my ass is sitting in my desk trying to get work done lolol
[7/2/18, 12:15:08 PM] Dev Naik: LOL
[7/2/18, 12:27:12 PM] Dev Naik: Damnit cmon
[7/2/18, 12:27:36 PM] Joe Stine: Scuffed goal
[7/2/18, 12:28:11 PM] Dev Naik: Ya...
[7/2/18, 12:31:44 PM] Dev Naik: Duck
[7/2/18, 12:31:53 PM] Joe Stine: REEEEEEEEEE
[7/2/18, 12:32:25 PM] Dev Naik: Screw Felani
[7/2/18, 12:32:34 PM] Dev Naik: Fellani*
[7/2/18, 12:35:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo I know I’m probably lame in saying this because it’s probably common knowledge but holy shit Neymar is a bitch
[7/2/18, 12:35:46 PM] Joe Stine: Facts
[7/2/18, 12:35:47 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Mohit is woke
[7/2/18, 12:35:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wtf was that
[7/2/18, 12:36:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He’s “writhing in pain”
[7/2/18, 12:36:11 PM] Dev Naik: He is a bitch that outplays his opponents
[7/2/18, 12:36:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Inb4 Dev starts ranting
[7/2/18, 12:36:26 PM] Joe Stine: 7-1
[7/2/18, 12:36:34 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao
[7/2/18, 12:36:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: My guy, he touched his ankle. Ain’t nobody rolling on the floor dying for touching an ankle
[7/2/18, 12:36:42 PM] Dev Naik: He wasn’t in that game
[7/2/18, 12:36:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He’s like the Brother Hughes of soccer
[7/2/18, 12:36:59 PM] Dev Naik: And neither was Thiago Silva
[7/2/18, 12:37:11 PM] Dev Naik: Except Neymar is actually good
[7/2/18, 12:37:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Brother Hughes gets buckets wtf are you talking about
[7/2/18, 12:37:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The man can shoot like crazy
[7/2/18, 12:37:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe not play defense
[7/2/18, 12:37:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or move
[7/2/18, 12:37:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But give him an open shot
[7/2/18, 12:37:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And he’ll make it
[7/2/18, 12:37:55 PM] Joe Stine: You're right it would've been 5-2
[7/2/18, 12:38:26 PM] Dev Naik: That’s fair Mohit, but who is he playing against lol
[7/2/18, 12:38:49 PM] Dev Naik: It really wouldn’t have been with the full Brasil side
[7/2/18, 12:39:36 PM] Dev Naik: Again I have never disagreed that Neymar is a bitch, but holy shit can he play
[7/2/18, 12:40:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: All I’m saying is, if he’s so badly hurt, he should be carted off right?
[7/2/18, 12:41:07 PM] Cameron Freeman: Aight on my break what I miss
[7/2/18, 12:41:10 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao you should see how much he actually gets fouled
[7/2/18, 12:41:30 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: You didn’t miss much. Neymar still a bitch
[7/2/18, 12:41:33 PM] Dev Naik: And how much smaller he is compared to the players around him
[7/2/18, 12:42:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah, lebron gets fouled a fuck ton too, he flops too but doesn’t mean he’s gunna fucking act like he’s having a heart attack on the floor so he gets a tech
[7/2/18, 12:42:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Is what I’m saying
[7/2/18, 12:42:21 PM] Dev Naik: What it’s the same thing...
[7/2/18, 12:42:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe ideas in soccer are different
[7/2/18, 12:43:07 PM] Dev Naik: Neymar gets fouled and he is selling the foul. Too much in my opinion but he still gets fouled
[7/2/18, 12:43:27 PM] Dev Naik: Holy shit those saves...
[7/2/18, 12:44:12 PM] Dev Naik: There are plenty of soccer players and basketball players who do the same...
[7/2/18, 12:44:27 PM] Dev Naik: People who flop and fake without getting touched at all
[7/2/18, 12:45:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The intensity of the flop is wildly different tho
[7/2/18, 12:45:37 PM] Dev Naik: I can agree with that he sells it way too much
[7/2/18, 12:45:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: JAPAN LETS GO
[7/2/18, 12:46:08 PM] Dev Naik: But so many players do that unfortunately
[7/2/18, 12:46:25 PM] Chase Larsen: Hahah Hughes
[7/2/18, 12:48:23 PM] Dev Naik: For example today when Layun stepped on his foot. Neymar did not need to flip and flop the way he did, but it deserved a card. Layun knew exactly what he was doing and it was a dirty act
[7/2/18, 12:48:29 PM] Dev Naik: Dude this game is nuts
[7/2/18, 12:51:21 PM] Dev Naik: What a shot and save
[7/2/18, 12:52:18 PM] Joe Stine: F
[7/2/18, 12:52:18 PM] Dev Naik: FUCK
[7/2/18, 12:52:21 PM] Dev Naik: F
[7/2/18, 12:52:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: SHIT
[7/2/18, 12:53:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I called it. I called a 3-2 belgium win in an extra time goal
[7/2/18, 12:54:50 PM] Dev Naik: Damn nice!!
[7/2/18, 2:34:33 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Rondo...rlly
[7/2/18, 2:34:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Wtf are the lakers doing
[7/2/18, 2:35:14 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They gonna trade everyone for kawhi and then have a starting 5 of new free agents
[7/2/18, 2:40:45 PM] Dev Naik: Yo anyone in town want to play some futbol later?
[7/2/18, 2:58:58 PM] Chase Larsen: They got rid of randle too
[7/2/18, 4:18:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wtf is happening to the lakers
[7/2/18, 5:38:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cousins to the fucking warriors
[7/2/18, 5:38:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Bro what the fuck
[7/2/18, 5:42:49 PM] Chris Cheng: 🙊
[7/2/18, 5:43:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s game with the West
[7/2/18, 5:52:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Inb4 warrior fans start saying “we have the splash brothers and now we have the splash cousin”
[7/2/18, 5:52:49 PM] Dev Naik: Lol
[7/2/18, 5:53:14 PM] Chase Larsen: I’m sorry warriors are unbeatable
[7/2/18, 5:53:26 PM] Dev Naik: Can there be a finals with just the West?
[7/2/18, 5:54:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: HEY
[7/2/18, 5:54:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: THE CELTICS STILL EXIST
[7/2/18, 5:54:20 PM] Chase Larsen: Boogie is the best big in the league, I mean cmon 

Curry
Thompson
Durant 
Green 
Cousins
[7/2/18, 5:54:25 PM] Dev Naik: Lolol
[7/2/18, 5:54:28 PM] Dev Naik: I know I know
[7/2/18, 5:54:29 PM] Chase Larsen: That’s literally the West all stars
[7/2/18, 5:54:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: This is gunna be disgusting
[7/2/18, 5:54:51 PM] Dev Naik: Facts lol
[7/2/18, 5:55:03 PM] Chase Larsen: How are you gonna guard that
[7/2/18, 5:55:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Kyrie can do it
[7/2/18, 5:55:21 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m down!
[7/2/18, 5:55:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He can guard all of them
[7/2/18, 5:55:27 PM] Dev Naik: YAS!
[7/2/18, 5:55:43 PM] Dev Naik: Let’s go to Fallon
[7/2/18, 5:55:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Just give him a couple months to train
[7/2/18, 5:55:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He can do it
[7/2/18, 5:55:53 PM] Dev Naik: People let’s go
[7/2/18, 5:55:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If he can be uncle drew. He can do anything
[7/2/18, 5:56:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Tired af from work, gunna hit the gym and finish project from school.
[7/2/18, 5:57:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: My b Dev
[7/2/18, 5:57:05 PM] Dev Naik: Futbol is the gym
[7/2/18, 5:57:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: No...........no it’s not lol
[7/2/18, 5:57:20 PM] Dev Naik: Yes yes it is
[7/2/18, 5:57:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nothing close to it
[7/2/18, 5:57:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s an exercise
[7/2/18, 5:57:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But it’s not the gym
[7/2/18, 5:57:35 PM] Dev Naik: Come see me on the field and tell me who will win
[7/2/18, 5:57:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You will win
[7/2/18, 5:57:54 PM] Dev Naik: Haha but you beat me in the “gym”
[7/2/18, 5:58:04 PM] Dev Naik: Anything can be a gym if you try hard enough
[7/2/18, 5:58:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Bro that makes absolutely no sense
[7/2/18, 5:58:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Am I lifting weights at soccer
[7/2/18, 5:58:28 PM] Dev Naik: Yes
[7/2/18, 5:58:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: They are 2 different activities
[7/2/18, 5:58:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Exercise but different focus
[7/2/18, 5:58:56 PM] Dev Naik: You will actually have the strongest legs ever
[7/2/18, 5:59:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If I play for hella fucking weeks continuously
[7/2/18, 5:59:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: 5$ mohit won’t go work out at Fallon
[7/2/18, 5:59:18 PM] Dev Naik: I have not met a soccer player who doesn’t have strong ass legs
[7/2/18, 5:59:22 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao
[7/2/18, 5:59:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course I won’t lol
[7/2/18, 5:59:38 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly just like the gym
[7/2/18, 6:00:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dawg. I can get to squating 2 plates at the gym faster than I can if I’m playing soccer
[7/2/18, 6:00:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: There’s no point in this argument
[7/2/18, 6:00:25 PM] Dev Naik: But I’d still beat you in a kick off
[7/2/18, 6:00:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m literally saying it’s an exercise just different focus
[7/2/18, 6:00:28 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cause youz a youz a bitch
[7/2/18, 6:00:35 PM] Dev Naik: Lol Neymar
[7/2/18, 6:01:07 PM] Dev Naik: Mohit = Neymar without soccer skills
[7/2/18, 6:01:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And I couldn’t care anymore than you would that I can out lift you
[7/2/18, 6:01:34 PM] Dev Naik: Facts lol
[7/2/18, 6:01:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: There ya go
[7/2/18, 6:01:48 PM] Dev Naik: I never disagreed there
[7/2/18, 6:01:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And I didnt either
[7/2/18, 6:02:17 PM] Dev Naik: I’m just saying maybe you should work out a different thing so you get stronger in different ways
[7/2/18, 6:02:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But when I’m trying to achieve a goal, and the most effective way to achieve that goal is the gym, I’d rather hit the gym..
[7/2/18, 6:03:01 PM] Dev Naik: Take Dustin for example he played futbol one day and he hurt his leg from kicking... his muscle is weak there so he couldn’t do it
[7/2/18, 6:03:16 PM] Dev Naik: If he played more he would have more muscle in more places
[7/2/18, 6:03:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s because Dustin doesn’t stretch for his fucking life
[7/2/18, 6:03:29 PM] Dev Naik: LOL
[7/2/18, 6:03:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If he stretched at the gym, he wouldn’t hurt himself anywhere
[7/2/18, 6:03:38 PM] Dev Naik: True
[7/2/18, 6:03:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I tell the man to roll out yesterday and he doesn’t fucking do it
[7/2/18, 6:03:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Instead does fuckinf flamingos and just normal stretches
[7/2/18, 6:07:48 PM] Cameron Freeman: Omg you guys sound like me and Ethan relax
[7/2/18, 6:08:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Bro this argument made no sense
[7/2/18, 6:08:09 PM] Frankie: It’s the Indian power struggle
[7/2/18, 6:08:13 PM] Frankie: Let it play out
[7/2/18, 6:08:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Omg
[7/2/18, 6:08:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: North vs South who will win
[7/2/18, 6:14:43 PM] Dev Naik: Lol in the absence of Ethan and Cam, I had to play my part in creating stupid arguments
[7/2/18, 6:15:41 PM] Dev Naik: On the real does anyone else want to play futbol?
[7/2/18, 6:16:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah I’m just waiting for my step dad to get home for us to have dinner

[7/5/18, 6:56:21 PM] Bryce Olson: What are my reasons for contesting the citation?
[7/5/18, 6:56:58 PM] Bryce Olson: I know some but I just want to make sure I say the right thing.

[7/5/18, 7:17:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: Shit Bryce i actually havnt a clue
[7/5/18, 7:23:30 PM] Bryce Olson: That’s fair
[7/5/18, 7:52:23 PM] Bryce Olson: How does this sound?  
I was told by the police to have my fireworks in the designated fireworks area and I was not the only person shooting off fireworks. Also I did not know the regulations for fireworks.
[7/5/18, 7:55:38 PM] Jonathan Ong: U should also say that the police did not specify what fireworks were allowed
[7/5/18, 7:56:25 PM] Bryce Olson: Ok thanks 🙏
[7/5/18, 7:59:52 PM] Chris Cheng: Ya tell em that the authorities told u where to shoot ur fireworks
[7/5/18, 8:03:42 PM] Bryce Olson: Better?
I was told by the police to have my fireworks in the designated fireworks area and they did not specify what fireworks were allowed. Also I did not know the regulations for fireworks in the area.
[7/5/18, 8:16:04 PM] Chris Cheng: Thats better
[7/5/18, 8:29:28 PM] Bryce Olson: 🤙🏻
[7/5/18, 9:09:03 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Plead ignorance and say that you were given these fireworks by a friend. You didn’t know they were illegal. You asked authorities were to shoot off fireworks and they pointed you into the designated location. From there you proceeded to use the necessary precautions of lighting fireworks in a safe manner. You have now been informed and will never do it again
[7/5/18, 9:10:00 PM] Chris Cheng: ^^
[7/5/18, 9:11:18 PM] Bryce Olson: Thanks Timmy that’s sounds perfect
[7/5/18, 9:11:24 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Also say that you will educate yourself about the laws in the future and ask for forgiveness
[7/5/18, 9:11:44 PM] Bryce Olson: Got it
[7/5/18, 9:23:47 PM] Dev Naik: Ya you also waited for the general area to be clear
[7/5/18, 9:23:57 PM] Dev Naik: So you were safe
[7/5/18, 9:24:09 PM] Dev Naik: It could be smart to research a little? Maybe?
[7/5/18, 9:24:29 PM] Dev Naik: To further prove you realize it was an honest mistake possibly?
[7/5/18, 9:24:41 PM] Dev Naik: But idk
[7/5/18, 9:24:43 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: This is important. Def do more research and see how people got out of similar situations
[7/5/18, 9:25:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If you have reddit, post on r/legaladvice
[7/5/18, 9:26:14 PM] Dev Naik: Maybe you could research the the firework itself and see the regulations on that?
[7/5/18, 9:26:35 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Aerial fireworks are illegal in California
[7/5/18, 9:26:53 PM] Dev Naik: Ah, damn there were hella going off
[7/5/18, 9:27:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Without proper liscenses
[7/5/18, 9:27:12 PM] Dev Naik: Ya I figured that
[7/5/18, 9:29:27 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: https://www.shouselaw.com/fireworks.html
Scroll down to where it says “Legal Defenses to CA firework charges”
[7/5/18, 9:30:04 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: You should prolly build your case around bullet point 4

[7/10/18, 4:31:47 PM] Frankie: They already had set plans to see ant man
[7/10/18, 4:32:10 PM] Frankie: You be wildin to ask them to change their plans when you gettin a invite
[7/10/18, 4:32:54 PM] Chris Cheng: Antmans was hilarious. I wanna see it again
[7/10/18, 4:32:56 PM] Dev Naik: It was asked before

[7/10/18, 4:35:06 PM] Frankie: Cause tbh I’d be down to see ant man if I could I’ve already seen incredibles. If it was incredibles I’d prolly just pass. Nice thing about being in a group chat with homies. They understand
[7/10/18, 4:37:40 PM] Dev Naik: I don’t care lol
[7/10/18, 4:40:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: It’s just anoying that I’m down all the time to hang out and do stuff with y’all and y’all are never down and it’s hard to actually plan a group thing and then ur all finally down and it’s something Iv been wanting to do with u guys and then it’s like the one thing I can’t
[7/10/18, 4:40:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: Just anoying
[7/10/18, 4:40:34 PM] Dev Naik: We don’t do anything together lmao
[7/10/18, 4:40:37 PM] Cameron Freeman: But cool everything’s cool
[7/10/18, 4:41:17 PM] Dev Naik: I feel ya but I mean you could watch antman again
[7/10/18, 4:41:55 PM] Dev Naik: But for your money it makes more sense to watch incredibles which we will watch next
[7/10/18, 4:43:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s the thing, next Tuesday, no one will be down. But it’s okay lol
[7/10/18, 4:44:33 PM] Dev Naik: I’m down
[7/10/18, 4:44:38 PM] Frankie: People are busy these days man. It has nothing to do with you. It’s just part of growing up :/

[7/10/18, 4:48:33 PM] Dev Naik: Yes but not literally 24 hours of every day of the week..
[7/10/18, 4:49:35 PM] Frankie: I’m just gonna use me as an example. I only work weekends and I hardly see you guys as it is. Id imagine it’s even harder for other people since honestly i don’t work that much
[7/10/18, 4:49:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: Didn’t want to get into it rn but yes people are busy I’m busy but it’s not people busy it’s priorities and laziness and just not wanting to hang a lot of the time which is fine whatever do you  Im just saying I’m anoyed everyone’s finally free and it’s something Iv already done
[7/10/18, 4:49:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Just sharing my feelings don’t need bull shit excuses or a response
[7/10/18, 4:50:11 PM] Cameron Freeman: I know you are you always are thank you
[7/10/18, 4:51:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m not mad I’m just dissaponted
[7/10/18, 4:53:11 PM] Frankie: I feel that and I’m sorry that’s how it’s making you feel. I’m sure it wasnt everyone’s intentions to cause that
[7/10/18, 4:55:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Is there a showing of incredibles at the same time? That way you can be with them before and after. Its not like you can talk in the movie anyways
[7/10/18, 4:56:12 PM] Dev Naik: 🤔🤯
[7/10/18, 4:57:05 PM] Owen Gilbert: But thats the thing cam, just because people are back in town doesn't necessarily mean they're free. And I dont think its about laziness, but priorities yes but different from what you're saying. I love hanging out with you guys but tbh you guys arent my number 1 priority. Which seems the same for others. I agree with what frankie said, life is a thing lol, we got shit, we're gonna see antman tonight and you guys can see incredibles another time
[7/10/18, 4:59:10 PM] Dev Naik: Da homies are family to me and family comes first. Just my view...
[7/10/18, 5:00:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: @19258955572 I should be free next Tuesday so I’m down for incredibles.
[7/10/18, 5:01:26 PM] Dev Naik: Obviously people have things to do and are busy, but you can always make time for people and activities to do
[7/10/18, 5:02:33 PM] Dev Naik: It’s a matter of how much effort people are willing to put in
[7/10/18, 5:08:44 PM] Dev Naik: Is anyone down to play futbol with max and I? Before the movie?
[7/10/18, 5:09:56 PM] Frankie: It does with important things. Just chillin is a diff
[7/10/18, 5:10:30 PM] Dev Naik: Why is chillin different tho?
[7/10/18, 5:10:44 PM] Dev Naik: We barely do anything lol
[7/10/18, 5:12:53 PM] Dev Naik: If anything at all
[7/10/18, 5:13:48 PM] Frankie: Give me a sec I’m driving
[7/10/18, 5:14:22 PM] Dev Naik: Hahaha aight
[7/10/18, 5:14:54 PM] Dev Naik: But is anyone free to play some futbol with max and I?
[7/10/18, 5:15:59 PM] Chris Cheng: Im still at work
[7/10/18, 5:16:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m in SF for Workday event till 10-11ish
[7/10/18, 5:16:58 PM] Dev Naik: Fosho
[7/10/18, 5:17:10 PM] Dev Naik: You wanna join after?
[7/10/18, 5:18:10 PM] Dev Naik: Also you guys care if I invite more people to the movie?
[7/10/18, 5:19:05 PM] Chris Cheng: It depends whether i have to stay overtime or not. We shorthanded here. I’ll lyk
[7/10/18, 5:19:41 PM] Dev Naik: Fosho we gonna go later anyway
[7/10/18, 5:19:46 PM] Dev Naik: Just lmk
[7/10/18, 5:23:12 PM] John Dong: Nah u can invite more
[7/10/18, 5:29:17 PM] Dev Naik: Aight
[7/10/18, 5:34:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: No, nor do I want to be your number one priority that would be weird. I’m talking about the prioritization of nothing over us majority of the time. I’m not talking about everyone, if anyone understands that people have a life it would be me I get it it’s the moments when nothing is chosen and that just speaks volumes and actions speak louder than words.
[7/10/18, 5:34:37 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exactly
[7/10/18, 5:42:31 PM] Owen Gilbert: If people can't or dont want to hang just let it be, you making it seem like a relationship with the "putting in effort" lol, its you guys, even if I can't or dont want to hang, you shouldn't put it on me that I'm not putting in effort. Like if I wanted to hang and you guys were just tired and didnt want to, I'd be like well get some rest we will hang out another time
[7/10/18, 5:43:02 PM] Frankie: I didn’t want to be the one to say it glad you did
[7/10/18, 5:43:09 PM] Dev Naik: Aight lol
[7/10/18, 5:43:46 PM] Dev Naik: Actions > words
[7/10/18, 5:45:39 PM] Dev Naik: I’m saying that in a general sense
[7/10/18, 5:50:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: See you are confused. I’m not telling you to do better or asking you. I’m literally sharing how I’m feeling. Not asking you to change it, because clearly I’m telling you I see that based on your actions you do not want to. This is the problem so many guys have with women. They do not listen or hear out what the girl is saying instead get defensive and try to respond instead of just listen and hear me out and accept the way I am feeling.
[7/10/18, 5:51:45 PM] Dev Naik: Facts tho
[7/10/18, 5:55:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: It’s up to you if you’d like to change anything. You can decide to reply when dev asks people to hang out every fucking day/ watch the fucking soccer game. It’s okay to be fucking busy or not but to just leave people on read with no response is just disrespectful and sorry that I expected better from my boys. So many people are so surprised when I say that I still have a relationship with friends from highscool not a whole lot of people do and it’s exactly for these reasons and I’m trying to shed light on this so I can continue having one because at this rate I feel like if it keeps going like this there won’t be one. You guys are super important to me and if you don’t think what we all have (definitely no homo) is special I get it forget it stop but there will be a day where none of us can watch a game together or hang out whenever we want and that day will come sooner than we think
[7/10/18, 5:56:59 PM] Owen Gilbert: My point is that its you guys. You guys aint my girlfriend lol. You guys dont wanna hang I say ok cool and move on. You guys can say whatever and do whatever and I'll just say ok cool and move on. You upset at not seeing incredible, the compromise was we will see it next week, and this wasnt about leaving someone on read lol, it was just people be busy/tired and it just so happens when people can hang tonight they wanna see antman
[7/10/18, 5:57:32 PM] Dustin Bradley: Cam we love you man and we are listening too you, but the problem is your not listening too us and carring about how we feel hence you saying “see you are confused”
[7/10/18, 5:58:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: Fuck the incredibles, you aren’t listening. This isn’t about a fucking movie this has been what Iv been feeling for a while now and it just opened up because of the movie
[7/10/18, 5:58:43 PM] Frankie: We are trying to explain to you our side and you are invalidating it
[7/10/18, 5:58:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: See that is how I’m feeling
[7/10/18, 5:59:04 PM] Dev Naik: No one is listening to anyone...
[7/10/18, 5:59:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because I’m just telling you how I feel. And you guys are telling me what I’m feeling is wrong
[7/10/18, 5:59:15 PM] Frankie: We aren’t saying it’s wrong
[7/10/18, 5:59:23 PM] Frankie: Just cut us some slack
[7/10/18, 6:01:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo. Cameron feels a certain way. Take it or leave it. There’s no arguing about it. His feelings are his and yours are yours. If you wanna see his side or if Cameron wants to see your side, that’s up to y’all. But there’s no point in trying to change opinions. Now why don’t we just stop all this, because it’s just destructive and try to figure out a way to hang out more and make this more productive. Jesus.
[7/10/18, 6:01:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: I agree
[7/10/18, 6:01:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: We going in circles and nothings progressing. So ima stop. Not getting anywhere. Sorry u don’t understand what I’m saying, and sorry you feel like I’m not understanding you
[7/10/18, 6:01:34 PM] Frankie: Sounds good
[7/10/18, 6:01:45 PM] Dev Naik: This hasn’t been productive at all lol... I agree we need to move forward and change with things
[7/10/18, 6:01:54 PM] Frankie: Likewise Cameron you all still my favorite homies
[7/10/18, 6:02:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s my fucking point. I’m saying this hasn’t been productive. It’s been destructive. So let’s stop the bullshit and just start plans.
[7/10/18, 6:02:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Now @19258955572 incredibles. Next Tuesday. Who’s down
[7/10/18, 6:03:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fuck man I’ve been at an event all day trying to respond but been busy.
[7/10/18, 6:03:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: This circle of arguments was annoying as fuck
[7/10/18, 6:03:40 PM] Dev Naik: Already said I was down

[7/10/18, 6:04:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright. Joe. My bad wish you could come with.
[7/10/18, 6:05:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I wish I could come tonight if I came back in time
[7/10/18, 6:06:30 PM] Frankie: I’m down to hang tonight also since I don’t know I can commit time wise to the movie
[7/10/18, 6:16:22 PM] Chris Cheng: Im down
[7/10/18, 6:20:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cameron Dev me Frankie Jon chris
[7/10/18, 6:35:23 PM] Owen Gilbert: Ay look no hard feelings, just didnt want people to feel bad that they were seeing antman rather than incredibles, and it just escalated. My b for arguing back. Obviously this was a super last minute decision for tonight and people said ya. But other stuff for the summer we can plan. Still need that party at your new place too bro
[7/10/18, 6:42:04 PM] Dev Naik: For anyone who is free before the movie y’all can meet at my place

[7/11/18, 11:35:38 AM] Dev Naik: Jusr can’t finish
[7/11/18, 12:25:25 PM] Dev Naik: What a goal...
[7/11/18, 12:25:29 PM] Chase Larsen: Trash
[7/11/18, 12:27:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im behind so I thought you were making a joke about kane hitting the side netting
[7/11/18, 12:27:32 PM] Dev Naik: Lol whoops
[7/11/18, 12:27:48 PM] Chase Larsen: No the luckiest goal ever that’s what we are talking about

[7/11/18, 12:29:02 PM] Dev Naik: Oh my goodness...
[7/11/18, 12:29:12 PM] Bryce Olson: Damn let’s go Croatia 🇭🇷
[7/11/18, 12:29:17 PM] Chase Larsen: They can’t even score on the easiest shots
[7/11/18, 12:29:28 PM] Chase Larsen: They don’t deserve a final
[7/11/18, 12:29:31 PM] Dev Naik: They meaning Harry Kane
[7/11/18, 12:29:55 PM] Dev Naik: Croatia just came to life after that goal
[7/11/18, 12:29:57 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Holy fuck
[7/11/18, 12:30:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Shit you guys, dont ruin it
[7/11/18, 12:30:27 PM] Chase Larsen: Trash shot
[7/11/18, 12:30:30 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Don’t look at your phone than lol
[7/11/18, 12:30:31 PM] Chase Larsen: Again
[7/11/18, 12:30:40 PM] Dev Naik: Ya just wait a minute hahaha
[7/11/18, 12:30:46 PM] Chase Larsen: That was an NFL field goal
[7/11/18, 12:30:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I have other things i need my phone for
[7/11/18, 12:30:50 PM] Dev Naik: Hahahahahah
[7/11/18, 12:31:04 PM] Dev Naik: From like 50 yards out
[7/11/18, 12:31:17 PM] Chase Larsen: Yep
[7/11/18, 12:32:00 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ethan are you watching ITV?
[7/11/18, 12:32:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yep. Buffstream ftw
[7/11/18, 12:32:59 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I do it for the commentary
[7/11/18, 12:33:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I cant do sound cuse of class
[7/11/18, 12:34:36 PM] Dev Naik: “Why is England trash” 
- Chase
[7/11/18, 12:35:09 PM] Chase Larsen: The attackers are
[7/11/18, 12:35:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Sterling is
[7/11/18, 12:36:09 PM] Dev Naik: And Kane
[7/11/18, 12:36:16 PM] Chase Larsen: No it’s just kane
[7/11/18, 12:36:33 PM] Dev Naik: Sterling has done the most work offensively for England this game..
[7/11/18, 12:41:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kane missed one opportunity, I dont think he is doing well but he isn’t doing awfully. Sterling has given the ball away on every possession, which he did last game as well
[7/11/18, 12:42:05 PM] Dev Naik: Kane is overrated
[7/11/18, 12:42:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Either way, if croatia goes to another shootout, they should be disqualified. Three shootouts in three knockout games, no real wins
[7/11/18, 12:42:22 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Agreed
[7/11/18, 12:42:41 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That’s dumb af
[7/11/18, 12:43:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They have 120 minutes to score, if they cant do that, thats boring as fuck and puts an asterisk on their wins
[7/11/18, 12:44:12 PM] Dev Naik: So do the other teams tho
[7/11/18, 12:44:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im obviously joking about dq’ing them, but croatia is not making this worth their while
[7/11/18, 12:44:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No it’s not boring af that’s why there’s penalty’s
[7/11/18, 12:44:34 PM] Dev Naik: And if they can defensively hold the teams they play they it’s all fair
[7/11/18, 12:44:39 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah Croatia is boring
[7/11/18, 12:44:41 PM] Dev Naik: And yes
[7/11/18, 12:45:37 PM] Dev Naik: Nah lol, best midfielders take  control of the game
[7/11/18, 12:45:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Penalties are just shooting on a goal, the goalie is placed at a serious disadvantage, shooting a penalty when no foul is given is the dumbest way to end a game
[7/11/18, 12:46:13 PM] Dev Naik: Makes it interesting and crazy tho
[7/11/18, 12:46:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Croatia is a great team, but to win all three of their games by penalties is boring
[7/11/18, 12:46:38 PM] Dev Naik: With that being said it would be better to win in the 120
[7/11/18, 12:46:44 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah
[7/11/18, 12:46:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thank you
[7/11/18, 12:47:09 PM] Dev Naik: But that doesn’t disregard the penalties
[7/11/18, 12:47:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Boring isn’t the right word. Cheap is better
[7/11/18, 12:47:25 PM] Dev Naik: Ya
[7/11/18, 12:47:34 PM] Chase Larsen: Nah
[7/11/18, 12:47:36 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Becuase pk shoutouts are exciting and if you win by them that’s exciting
[7/11/18, 12:47:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I mean boring in that way, just lack of a better word
[7/11/18, 12:47:44 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cheap
[7/11/18, 12:47:53 PM] Chase Larsen: We want England

[7/11/18, 12:48:13 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Who are you arguing
[7/11/18, 12:48:18 PM] Dev Naik: Nah France got this lol
[7/11/18, 12:48:35 PM] Dev Naik: Viva la France
[7/11/18, 12:48:42 PM] Chase Larsen: Lol I just really want England to win and I’m just joking about Croatia being trash
[7/11/18, 12:48:44 PM] Dev Naik: Pogba diaries
[7/11/18, 12:49:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: France England is almost as good as a France Belgium final
[7/11/18, 12:49:19 PM] Dev Naik: Kane could have done better

[7/18/18, 12:22:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes she, i was paying attention
[7/18/18, 12:26:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahhh shit my b
[7/18/18, 12:51:27 PM] Dustin Bradley: Did you just assume her gender? @19259980019 @19256993963
[7/18/18, 12:51:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes, what are you gonna do about it
[7/18/18, 12:54:54 PM] Dustin Bradley: Nothing because I cant force people too think differently about ones own gender and besides I’ve lost count of all the different types to be honest I feel like there spontaneously created each day
[7/18/18, 12:57:04 PM] Dustin Bradley: Sorry that was off topic but the first sentence wasn’t so you get the bird Ethan 🖕🏻
[7/18/18, 12:57:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Lmao
[7/18/18, 12:57:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The fuck is going on
[7/18/18, 12:59:05 PM] Dustin Bradley: Top controversies from Ape Are there only two types of genders?
[7/18/18, 12:59:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: This is not the time
[7/18/18, 12:59:42 PM] Dustin Bradley: Post your thoughts down below

[7/18/18, 1:00:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: No
[7/18/18, 1:00:13 PM] Chase Larsen: It’s ape’s own segment of change my mind hahah
[7/18/18, 1:00:44 PM] Dev Naik: So dumb
[7/18/18, 1:00:46 PM] Dustin Bradley: @15858201670 🦅
[7/18/18, 1:01:08 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: If you flick me the bird I’ll flick your bean
[7/18/18, 1:01:12 PM] Dev Naik: The change my mind segments that is, just in my opinion
[7/18/18, 1:01:18 PM] Dev Naik: Hahahahahahaha
[7/18/18, 1:03:39 PM] Dustin Bradley: If you are the bird that flicks my bean then I flick your chicks
[7/18/18, 1:03:40 PM] Chase Larsen: I don’t know obviously Steven crowder is not really that open to changing his opinions, but I like watching them. You get to see two sides discussing issues, and it’s nice to see both sides be respectful
[7/18/18, 1:04:26 PM] Dustin Bradley: Then I’ll flick your sprouts
[7/18/18, 1:04:36 PM] Dustin Bradley: Bitch
[7/18/18, 1:05:06 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The problem with “change my mind” segment is Crowder is a well versed debater and he knows what he’s talking about. So when kids come up and debate facts with emotion they will get shut down
[7/18/18, 1:05:34 PM] Chase Larsen: Yeah that true
[7/18/18, 1:06:18 PM] Dev Naik: I wouldn’t say everything he says is facts
[7/18/18, 1:06:41 PM] Dustin Bradley: Have you seen the one about white privileged
[7/18/18, 1:06:49 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Dev he uses stats to back up his points. He strengthens his arguments not based on emotion but based of data
[7/18/18, 1:07:12 PM] Dev Naik: I’ve seen his segments and some times the stats are not true
[7/18/18, 1:07:28 PM] Dev Naik: Not all the time but in some circumstances
[7/18/18, 1:07:40 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Prove it. What episode
[7/18/18, 1:07:49 PM] Dev Naik: Data which is also sometimes skewed
[7/18/18, 1:07:52 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The debates can only extend so far. People don’t know statistics off the top of their head. He does. He prepares for these debates. Plus there is a biased in what he shows
[7/18/18, 1:07:55 PM] Dustin Bradley: Why do you say that @19256993454 do you have proof
[7/18/18, 1:08:09 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya but can you pinpoint what the data was
[7/18/18, 1:08:19 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I’m not saying I don’t believe you I’m just curious
[7/18/18, 1:08:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: Show us the data
[7/18/18, 1:08:34 PM] Dev Naik: Maybe not in the change my mind segments, but in the one about climate change
[7/18/18, 1:08:50 PM] Dev Naik: I don’t know what segment it is but the data he used in it was off
[7/18/18, 1:09:02 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ok but I was just talking about “change my mindL
[7/18/18, 1:09:09 PM] Dev Naik: Just something I observed from him
[7/18/18, 1:09:22 PM] Chase Larsen: Oh well yeah most conservatives don’t believe in global warming even if they see studies on it hahah
[7/18/18, 1:09:32 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: My point is that people don’t know stats of the top of their head and even stats don’t show everything
[7/18/18, 1:10:01 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That’s what makes the segment so biased
[7/18/18, 1:10:03 PM] Dev Naik: He literally stated a stat from a source which later disproved they argument he made
[7/18/18, 1:10:14 PM] Dev Naik: This is true
[7/18/18, 1:10:29 PM] Dev Naik: And I realize I meant to talk about him
[7/18/18, 1:11:09 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Stats don’t mean shit if you don’t know how to interpret correctly
[7/18/18, 1:11:14 PM] Dev Naik: Yes it does
[7/18/18, 1:13:01 PM] Dev Naik: He is preaching to a choir so he only shows whatever one sided discussions happen on that segment
[7/18/18, 1:14:17 PM] Dev Naik: But such is about everything now a days
[7/18/18, 1:15:23 PM] Chase Larsen: I mean I wouldn’t say I’m a Steven crowded fan but I do enjoy watching his show, just like I like watching Bill Maher’s show for the discussions, even though he’s  against a lot of things I’m for
[7/18/18, 1:16:12 PM] Chase Larsen: I think people should watch opposing views and debates more
[7/18/18, 1:16:39 PM] Dev Naik: That’s fair, I don’t enjoy watching because it’s not helping anything much besides entertainment
[7/18/18, 1:17:08 PM] Dev Naik: I agree but something which is more civil and evenly debated in my opinion
[7/18/18, 1:18:02 PM] Dev Naik: The white male privilege one Dustin?
[7/18/18, 1:18:52 PM] Chase Larsen: I don’t know I feel like you can learn a lot about where people come from in their arguments when you watch
[7/18/18, 1:20:24 PM] Dev Naik: Most of what I see in crowders videos is him appeasing one side and trolling the other. I feel like you can learn a lot more from something where both sides almost come together, again no clue what that is but if that was ever possible lol
[7/18/18, 1:30:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: Guys Makayla wanted me to tell you guys that Friday she’s throwing a party at her place for AJ lows birthdsy
[7/18/18, 1:30:49 PM] Dev Naik: Yups!
[7/18/18, 2:24:02 PM] Owen Gilbert: The 4th of july video should finally be done, took a while but its done. Bryce it does include everything that I filmed with you, if you still dont want that online I'll just make it private so you guys can see it, if you good with it, it should be up tomorrow

[7/22/18, 11:19:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Japantown to Campus between 4th and 10th street

[7/22/18, 11:32:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: From Bernal Park to Sports Park? Are you thinking bigger?
[7/22/18, 11:33:41 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s super main rodey but maybe?
[7/22/18, 11:35:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: You have to go down Bernal and valley and then hopyard
[7/22/18, 11:35:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: The three main streets in Pleasanton 😂😂
[7/22/18, 11:35:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Movie theater to fallon
[7/22/18, 11:35:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Or other way
[7/22/18, 11:35:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s all main rode bro!
[7/22/18, 11:36:01 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Eh, yeah i guess so
[7/22/18, 11:36:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Other than the neighborhood right next to Fallon
[7/22/18, 11:36:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That was what I was thinking about
[7/22/18, 11:37:48 PM] Cameron Freeman: But then Dublin blvd and hacienda the two main Dublin’s streets lol
[7/22/18, 11:37:55 PM] Joe Stine: International Blvd to the Oakland Coliseum
[7/22/18, 11:37:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Ye you right
[7/22/18, 11:38:13 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Telegraph to UCB
[7/22/18, 11:38:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol
[7/22/18, 11:38:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: But hmmm Dublin May have a lot neighborhood that could b good
[7/22/18, 11:39:10 PM] Dev Naik: Dublin has a lot of cops
[7/22/18, 11:39:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: True
[7/22/18, 11:39:41 PM] Cameron Freeman: But I mean if we follow driving laws boarder patrol isn’t illegal
[7/22/18, 11:39:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: If anything it’s more legal in Dublin considering u can b out at dark
[7/22/18, 11:42:11 PM] Dev Naik: It’s more so people running around
[7/22/18, 11:42:26 PM] Dev Naik: This is also true tho
[7/22/18, 11:42:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Which isn’t illegal
[7/22/18, 11:42:49 PM] Dev Naik: Well it’s suspicious
[7/22/18, 11:43:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: True
[7/22/18, 11:43:34 PM] Dev Naik: Idk but it’s an idea which I like
[7/22/18, 11:45:40 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Captain Falon Park to Emerald Glen Park
[7/22/18, 11:45:58 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Lots of backroads and the parks are huge
[7/22/18, 11:46:28 PM] Dev Naik: How far is that? It’s not too far but it could be good
‎[7/22/18, 11:48:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: ‎image omitted
‎[7/22/18, 11:48:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: ‎image omitted
[7/22/18, 11:48:24 PM] Dev Naik: Eh not too far but I’m still down for it
[7/22/18, 11:48:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: That could work, might be to quick? And kinda one way to go
[7/22/18, 11:49:04 PM] Dev Naik: Ya it’s not long enough I think
[7/22/18, 11:49:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s not a main road
[7/22/18, 11:49:08 PM] Owen Gilbert: We will make it far cause people wont go in a straight line
[7/22/18, 11:49:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: But they have to
[7/22/18, 11:49:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: Those streets are all dead ends
[7/22/18, 11:49:52 PM] Dev Naik: I know there are main roads but foothill to Amador or vice versa lol
[7/22/18, 11:50:12 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s dick far
[7/22/18, 11:50:36 PM] Dev Naik: Almost 4 miles
[7/22/18, 11:50:38 PM] Dev Naik: Lol
[7/22/18, 11:50:45 PM] Dev Naik: That would be LIT
[7/22/18, 11:51:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: When it’s that far there are so many different routes that the patrol it would be almost impossible to find anyone
[7/22/18, 11:51:28 PM] Dev Naik: That’s true
[7/22/18, 11:51:41 PM] Dev Naik: Maybe something smaller like sports park or tennis park to Amador
[7/22/18, 11:51:57 PM] Dev Naik: Too many main roads tho
[7/22/18, 11:55:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: Anyone remember when we did harvest park to Amador? And how we did tennis park to harvest park. We can do tennis park to Amador! So you’d have to go all through tennis park neighborhood and those neighborhoods around harvest and then neighrbhoods by harvest park and then Amador.. idk
[7/22/18, 11:56:35 PM] Dev Naik: That was my though too but if can be difficult with the main roads maybe
[7/22/18, 11:56:41 PM] Dev Naik: I’m game tho
[7/22/18, 11:57:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: We can say you can only cross the main rodes to get to the neighborhoods and not actually run on the main rodes
[7/22/18, 11:57:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: If ur caught running on the main rodes by patrol that’s automatic out
[7/22/18, 11:57:52 PM] Dev Naik: That’s fair! I think it works!
[7/22/18, 11:58:21 PM] Dev Naik: Ya unless you are getting to the other side or something
[7/22/18, 11:59:35 PM] Dev Naik: There is nothing in the rules against a bike right?
‎[7/23/18, 12:09:24 AM] Cameron Freeman: ‎image omitted
[7/23/18, 12:09:34 AM] Cameron Freeman: What
[7/23/18, 12:09:43 AM] Cameron Freeman: We can do middle of sports park to Amador?
[7/23/18, 12:18:13 AM] Dev Naik: May I ride a bike lol
[7/23/18, 12:18:30 AM] Dev Naik: I’m game for that or tennis park
[7/23/18, 12:18:39 AM] Cameron Freeman: No Dev
[7/23/18, 12:18:59 AM] Cameron Freeman: Middle of sports park Is longer and offers different routes
[7/23/18, 12:36:44 AM] Dev Naik: Damn lol
[7/23/18, 12:36:49 AM] Dev Naik: Ok sounds good
[7/23/18, 12:20:55 PM] Dev Naik: What’s the move for today?
[7/23/18, 12:47:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: 🤔
[7/23/18, 1:08:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dawg. Why not do near Owen’s old house near fairlands
[7/23/18, 1:08:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We could do the park all the way at the end to the tennis courts where we set off fireworks that one year
‎[7/23/18, 1:09:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ‎image omitted
[7/23/18, 1:12:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Tons of neighborhood
[7/23/18, 1:13:00 PM] Cameron Freeman: Oh sweet yeah that can work
[7/23/18, 1:13:49 PM] Dev Naik: I feel like it’s not that long tho
[7/23/18, 1:14:16 PM] Dev Naik: But it’s a good route

[7/30/18, 12:24:56 AM] Chase Larsen: Well Dustin is very conservative as we all know...
[7/30/18, 12:24:58 AM] Chase Larsen: Hahah

[7/30/18, 12:26:44 AM] Dustin Bradley: Dude I’m thinking it’s a catfish and that it’s acually a dude posing as a girl
[7/30/18, 12:26:49 AM] Chase Larsen: Oh is it really
[7/30/18, 12:27:00 AM] Owen Gilbert: Dustin you're following her on insta😂
[7/30/18, 12:27:01 AM] Dev Naik: What proof you got of that lmao..
[7/30/18, 12:27:03 AM] Mohit Veligenti: People are different. If you think she’s weird or some shit because she’s bi, leave it be and say hey it was nice talking to you. This isn’t a “situation”
[7/30/18, 12:27:12 AM] Dev Naik: Facts
[7/30/18, 12:27:17 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t know why it’s such a big deal
[7/30/18, 12:27:21 AM] Dev Naik: Facts
[7/30/18, 12:27:30 AM] Chase Larsen: Because Dustin makes everything a big deal
[7/30/18, 12:27:36 AM] Chase Larsen: Cmon we are dealing with ape
[7/30/18, 12:27:39 AM] Chase Larsen: Think haha
[7/30/18, 12:27:45 AM] Mohit Veligenti: If you think it’s a catfish, you are an attractive man. Stop selling yourself short and just end it and leave.
[7/30/18, 12:27:45 AM] Dev Naik: Also it shouldn’t matter even if she is bi lol...
[7/30/18, 12:28:00 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Dev it’s his opinion, if he feels it, no point changing it
[7/30/18, 12:28:17 AM] Dustin Bradley: I regret starting this conversation
[7/30/18, 12:28:20 AM] Mohit Veligenti: He’ll see it through someday but today isn’t the day
[7/30/18, 12:28:30 AM] Dev Naik: I guess but don’t sell people short because of their beliefs is all I’m saying
[7/30/18, 12:28:30 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Don’t regret it
[7/30/18, 12:28:56 AM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s just Dustin’s nature. I don’t think he sells them short. He just doesn’t feel comfortable
[7/30/18, 12:29:02 AM] Dev Naik: Gotta stay woke
[7/30/18, 12:29:05 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin. What do you want to do.
[7/30/18, 12:29:11 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Or what do you want us to do
[7/30/18, 12:29:21 AM] Owen Gilbert: Have you dmed her on insta?
[7/30/18, 12:29:34 AM] Chase Larsen: Or just say be respectful
[7/30/18, 12:29:34 AM] Dev Naik: That’s fair, but I think it’s based of judgment
[7/30/18, 12:29:36 AM] Dustin Bradley: Guys i was trying to be funny but y’all took it way out of context
[7/30/18, 12:30:04 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin nobody can tell if you’re trying to be funny or serious because you type the same way with both lol
[7/30/18, 12:30:11 AM] Owen Gilbert: ^^^
[7/30/18, 12:30:15 AM] Dev Naik: Yes but stay woke my friend. You have to stay woke
[7/30/18, 12:30:21 AM] Chase Larsen: Sorry nothing against you Dev for some reason I don’t like when people say stay woke
[7/30/18, 12:30:26 AM] Chase Larsen: I honestly don’t know
Why
[7/30/18, 12:30:31 AM] Chase Larsen: But yes I agree

[7/30/18, 12:31:12 AM] Owen Gilbert: But Dustin were you serious about the catfish? Or?
[7/30/18, 12:31:22 AM] Owen Gilbert: About you thinking it
[7/30/18, 12:31:56 AM] Dustin Bradley: You guess take my words and twist it from what I’m acually trying to convey
[7/30/18, 12:32:08 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin. No one is twisting anything
[7/30/18, 12:32:18 AM] Mohit Veligenti: What are you trying to actually say
[7/30/18, 12:32:20 AM] Dev Naik: Ya wut?
[7/30/18, 12:32:26 AM] Chase Larsen: Ya Dustin
[7/30/18, 12:32:32 AM] Dev Naik: I called you and you literally screamed....
[7/30/18, 12:32:41 AM] Mohit Veligenti: If we are twisting it, what is the actual meaning. I’m so lost.
[7/30/18, 12:32:45 AM] Owen Gilbert: I'm talking bout this bro, no twisting lol
[7/30/18, 12:32:56 AM] Chase Larsen: Honestly Dustin and I are just sitting in a car laughing don’t take anything seriously
[7/30/18, 12:33:02 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Jesus

[9/7/18, 1:54:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo not to be all sappy and corny and shit, but man this Mac Miller thing kinda hits me. I don’t wanna lose any of you guys to this type of situation. And I know all you guys are good with not doing any shit like this man, but if it does come to the situation, please don’t do it. I’ve been there and I’ve done shit I probably shouldn’t have, but please don’t do hard core shit man. I don’t wanna lose any of my brothers
[9/7/18, 1:55:21 PM] Dev Naik: 100% 🙌🏾❤

[9/7/18, 1:58:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Same goes for like drinking and stuff as well. It’s not like weed and alcohol are just cool. Still substance abuse even if it’s regulated. So please just be careful man.

[9/7/18, 1:59:07 PM] Dev Naik: Depression is just a part of life, it doesn’t define any individual and most certainly is just a phase that people go through. You all know every one of us is there for eachother going through anything and everything. I love my brothers, and we have each others backs always. Whatever it may be from just listening to talking or giving helpful advice

[9/23/18, 12:31:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hey guys. So I have a call tomorrow with a decent company and i don’t wanna fuck it up. Are there any questions I could ask them when the recruiter says “do you have any questions about the company or job or anything” and all. I always never have questions because they explain it pretty thoroughly so I’m like, i don’t know and I know it’s really good to ask like good questions so they know you are interested and actively thinking.
[9/23/18, 12:32:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s like an interview/phone call to learn more about the company
[9/23/18, 12:32:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Do research into the company and ask about specific things they have done
[9/23/18, 12:32:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: See. It’s a big company. So like, there’s a lot. Should I just pick like specifics
[9/23/18, 12:32:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And like small sectors of it
[9/23/18, 12:33:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Something you find interest in and what you would work on if you were there
[9/23/18, 12:33:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahh okay okay
[9/23/18, 12:33:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Ask how promotion and movement in the company works and how likely it is
[9/23/18, 12:33:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And how I can expand my skill set within the company with movement?
[9/23/18, 12:34:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Sure
[9/23/18, 12:34:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright these are some good ass questions
[9/23/18, 12:34:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: All questions are welcome. I got 1 hour with the recruiter so I gotta wow the fuck outta them
[9/23/18, 12:34:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And more questions means easier on my interview
[9/23/18, 12:35:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Thanks @19256993963

[10/3/18, 9:44:24 AM] Dev Naik: Like if you wanted it to look incredible clean, also depending on the style you want the lower back area should be hugging your back so the suit countours itself to you back if that makes sense

[10/14/18, 6:20:42 PM] Dustin Bradley: It’s actually really good

[10/14/18, 6:21:37 PM] Owen Gilbert: I heard blackout is really good, theres zombies that spawn in too, the only shit part ive heard is the inventory system is shit, terribly organized, and the loot you try to pick up you can barely see what the fuck it is unkess you pick it up
[10/14/18, 6:22:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: What about base game stuff? Campaign and main multiplayer?
[10/14/18, 6:22:22 PM] Joe Stine: The game is only good for blackout

[11/3/18, 4:25:49 PM] Dustin Bradley: Hey guys I know we talked about this before and it’s been on my mind but I just wanted to let you all know that I’m very proud of how far we’ve come not just as a group but individually. I know each and every one of you can be successful although we have our off days there’s always a bright future awaiting. I also want to bring up a topic we never really discuss because we kind of just slide over it and whenever we do talk about it, it’s very brief, but if you feel like sharing please do. As we all know life is one big curve ball and at sometimes things can be very stressful and difficult ex: family, school, social, financial, relationships, jobs, etc. I care about every single one of and I mean it truly. You all are what I would call a collective family when we see one of our members fall short we pick them up what I like to call giving them a crutch to support them. I honestly feel the best way to be supportive to one another is talk about our feelings not to be cliche but it really does help if everyone gets involved without any hazing or jokes involved it can be tremendously helpful. Also, because these are personal issues that If someone wants to share are confidential please be respectful. I trust and know all of you will just wanted to give a heads up
[11/3/18, 4:29:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: 200% agree bro! Very well said! Love you! Love you all!

I’m a strong believer in everything happening for a reason, and it’s actually incredible that you sent that message.

[11/9/18, 8:31:08 AM] Dev Naik: Hey you guys, I figured I should tell you all what I’ve been kinda going through. Lindsay and I broke up, I know not all of you even met her, but I genuinely was in love with her. It seems crazy that I could pretty much see her as the love of my life and I really wish our relationship could last longer into the future but at the moment it isn’t feasible. It hurts so much to have someone you love so much not be with you. I’ve been super sad on top of already kind of feeling drepressed and overwhelmed. I’ve been dealing with depression for some time now, and this adds on so much more. I have a really low self esteem and don’t see my self worth. I wished that people could see that I just want to help people around me. I end up just feeling like a burden and worthless. Sometimes I wish I had a different life. I don’t bring it up often, but I’m a low point at the moment and I really want to make myself happier. I want to look in the mirror and love what I see, not hate it. I really don’t know what I would do without my friends because you are such a solid part of my life and you bring me happiness. I want to reach out because I feel like I really need it.
[11/9/18, 8:48:45 AM] Bryce Olson: Dev we got you. Also I been going through something similar honestly and we need to keep our head up high. Because life is to short and worry about what can be or what come have been is something at we can’t worry about. And bro I’m always down to talk through things because that’s what we need to do sometimes. Always got you bro!!
[11/9/18, 8:58:04 AM] Dev Naik: Thank you Bryce! You are way too right, life is too short. Thanks for the words, it means a lot.
[11/9/18, 9:00:33 AM] Bryce Olson: No problem bro always got your back and everyone else’s 🤙🏻
[11/9/18, 9:29:47 AM] Dustin Bradley: Dev and Bryce I want you both too know I love of you guys also I really want to thank both of you for the courage to share your guy’s feelings it just goes to show that there is a strong bond between us brothers. Dev you are such a good person at heart your a selfless individual who puts others before himself and I truly believe along the road someone will genuinely love you for what you are and you my friend are a rock that stands out against the pebbles. Im always a phone call away Dev and ill just listen because I care what’s going on in your life and I want the best for you just like your family and just like every single one of us in this group chat Life only gets harder from here our bodies are getting older tattered and worn down, our search for careers is fruitful but at the cost of our free time, and finding that special someone is hard for a few of us but you know what not spoil the ending but everything is going to be okay just like this huge run on sentence.
[11/9/18, 9:31:26 AM] Dustin Bradley: Love you man stay strong and just know that in the end everything is going to be okay
[11/9/18, 9:32:13 AM] Dustin Bradley: Same goes for you Bryce
[11/9/18, 9:36:37 AM] Dustin Bradley: Stay strong my friend and try maybe a little less weed hahahahaha jk you do you man and keep on doing ultimate because one day I’ll show up and take your spot maybe...
[11/9/18, 9:44:00 AM] Dev Naik: Thank you Dustin, that really means a lot, I miss you all and I can’t wait to be back spending time with you all. You have such a positive impact on my life
[11/9/18, 9:48:04 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Dev you said that you don’t see your self worth, but I see it. I get inspired from your relentless hard work at the Studio, your passion to follow your dreams, and the genuine kindness from your heart. It’s rare to find someone as passionate and as real as you. I’m sorry that your relationship ended even though I never knew Lindsay. However, I know you Dev, and I know that if anyone could overcome this in their life than that would be you. If you ever need to get anything off your chest or just vent about your day I’m only a phone call or text bubble away.
[11/9/18, 9:53:58 AM] Dev Naik: Thanks Tim, I appreciate your friendship and your words so much. It really all means a lot to me. You have really made me be happier in my life, thanks for showing me the lighter side of life. That goes for everyone
[11/9/18, 9:54:49 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I love you and your like family to me. I can’t wait to see you as spend time with you. Like Dustin said you are a positive beacon in my life
[11/9/18, 9:55:22 AM] Dev Naik: So are you, thanks for being there
[11/9/18, 10:03:07 AM] Chase Larsen: Dev and Bryce I just wanted to let you guys know how important you are to me and everyone in this group. You have helped me and been there for me through little problems that I’ve had. You’ve taken time to really listen to me, and try to guide me in life. I had a great time with you this last summer. I know that you can overcome these obstacles thrown at you, and if you ever need somebody to talk you know we are all here for you.
[11/9/18, 10:17:46 AM] Dev Naik: Thank you Chase, right back at you, you always listen to what I say and help me through whatever I need. I need to talk to you before you leave
[11/9/18, 10:18:22 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Everyone goes through this unfortunately. And it won’t be the last time you do, as when I went through my bout of depression Freshman year, I knew it wasn’t my last time. There is always more to life, always more girls who you will love, always more hobbies that catch your interest, always more opportunities for someone to grow. I know it is hard, but anyone here should be proud of what they accomplish. Even just one good grade is an amazing feeling, or one finished project. With the workload I have currently, stress and anxiety come easy, so I have to focus on the little wins here and there. I have been congratulated by my CEO, and while that means little as our company is small and he recognizes people every week, I honestly was so happy to even know someone thought I did well. Even if I didn’t though, I take pride in every report I do for my job. It takes a while and it is painstaking, but it is so rewarding just because I finish. Little wins. Pretending those mean the world has helped so much the past couple years, because you see there are little wins every day and those little wins add up.
[11/9/18, 10:20:12 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: And honestly, the best thing to help (for me), is to vent out your frustrations, and to live healthy. Eat well, exercise. I haven’t done it lately but even just walking to class or walking late at night just to walk can make a difference
[11/9/18, 10:22:22 AM] Dev Naik: Thank you Ethan, those are strong words that I will do the most to take to my heart. The little things matter so much, and I really appreciate all the things you do and your company in my life
[11/9/18, 10:22:43 AM] Dev Naik: You mean a lot
[11/9/18, 10:23:11 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: ❤
[11/9/18, 10:23:12 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ethan brings up a really good point. I think it’s been shown that exercise helps with depression. Personally for me it just takes my mind of what’s bothering me and just focus on pumping out those gains
[11/9/18, 10:24:07 AM] Dev Naik: It’s true, I want to focus on myself and make myself happier and what you put in is what you get out
[11/9/18, 10:24:12 AM] Dev Naik: ❤
[11/9/18, 10:31:10 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: As much as you are going to want to though, force yourself to hang out with people. Time alone isn’t the worst thing, but it won’t help if that is all you have
[11/9/18, 10:32:11 AM] Dev Naik: True
[11/9/18, 10:33:22 AM] Chase Larsen: Totally Dev! And that goes for all
of you guys. It would be awesome to get to talk to you all. I thought it would be cool if we shared some sort of goals for these next couple years, if you don’t want to you don’t have to. You guys are all just really important and I would love to hear what’s important to you and see if we could help each other through
[11/9/18, 10:42:36 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Dev, I’m sorry to hear about Lindsay. But just know that you aren’t alone in this. You may have experienced it alone, but you know we are here to help. You are strong dev. You know it. I know it. Everyone here knows it. Deep down you know it, it’s just clouded. And that’s why we are here to help ya get rid of that cloudiness. And me saying you are worth it is gunna mean little to nothing unless you believe it yourself. Your belief in yourself is the strongest thing you have. Maybe it’s weakened by the situation but it’s there. You need to reach down and pull that out. And I know it’s gunna be painful to get past thing but you will. And you are going to find someone that loves you and appreciates who you are. Your helping nature. Your fandom for soccer. And appreciate EVERYTHING about you. Because you DESERVE that person. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, ESPECIALLY YOURSELF. Also, try to grab a notebook and write down all your positive aspects and negative aspects and what you love about yourself. It sounds small but I remember when I was feeling depressed and didn’t find worth in myself, I wrote it down and tried to reflect on why I felt that way, and it felt like a release. It helped me get a holistic view of myself and if I didn’t write down anything positive, I FORCED myself to create something to be able to put there or asked the people around me. Because to be able to find self worth you gotta love yourself, and you gotta love all of yourself, including your positive and negatives. You will find that worth Dev I promise. I love you my brother. Try to find some time to put into exercise or something that YOU love. Whether it’s playing, soccer going for a walk or entering the iron temple and lifting the weights the mighty BrOdin has blessed our earth with, something to better yourself. And you know I’m a phone call away. We are always here to talk about this stuff or anything. Any small time you just don’t feel good on any day, just shoot us a text. There is a guarantee that one of us will respond. On a side note when you coming back in December?
[11/9/18, 10:48:46 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Also ethan makes a very good point.
[11/9/18, 10:52:43 AM] Dev Naik: Wow thanks Mohit, I will take up that advice and write some things down. Appreciate the words of wisdom and I’ll strive to do the most. I love you lots and I’m excited to see you soon. I come back I think December 12 or something
[11/9/18, 10:53:23 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Forsure. We’ll all hang out then most def. I come back a little later.
[11/9/18, 10:54:37 AM] Mohit Veligenti: And of course dude. Take some time for yourself but don’t forget to live your best life.
[11/9/18, 10:58:00 AM] Dev Naik: I will do my best
[11/9/18, 11:54:36 AM] Chris Cheng: Dev, I’m sorry to hear about Lindsay. I know it must have been tough. But thank you for reaching out! I’m here for you. We’re all here for you❤. Dev, of all the people I know, I honestly can’t think of anyone more selfless and optimistic as you are. I love that about you and I’m sure any girl out there values those traits and should be lucky just to be with you because you’re such an amazing person. I want to tell you something that has changed my perspective on how I deal with uncertainties in life that can feel so overwhelming: “If a door doesn’t open for you, then it wasn’t the door you’re meant to go through.” This applies to everything in my life. Before I asked out Yvette, I was thinking about these words. Before every job interview, I think about these words. I really want you to take these words in because it has given me peace of mind to know that there is an opportunity (door) for me. It’s just waiting for me to open it. All the doubts and negative things go away. Just keep being you, Dev. Keep working hard like you are, and I’m certain that you will find the things you’re looking for. I love you Dev, I love everyone in this group chat, and I love how we all pick each other up when one of us falls down. It shows our true characters as friends.
[11/9/18, 11:56:46 AM] Chris Cheng: In the meantime, I think you should take some time for yourself. Like Mohit said, do the things you love and make you happy and stress-free.
[11/9/18, 11:57:41 AM] Chris Cheng: Can’t wait to see you again Dev, and can’t wait to see all of you again.
[11/9/18, 11:58:38 AM] Bryce Olson: Hell yea can’t wait to see guys❤
[11/9/18, 11:58:50 AM] Dev Naik: Thank you Chris, the words mean a lot and I look forward to finding the right doors in my life. I love you too and I know that the door that led me to you all has been on of the best doors in my life. Thank you so much, excited to see you soon
[11/9/18, 11:59:50 AM] Chris Cheng: You’re welcome🤗. I’m always here for ya. Always a phone call, text, or wtv away.
[11/9/18, 12:01:26 PM] Dev Naik: Likewise❤
[11/9/18, 12:09:17 PM] Joe Stine: Hey Dev I'm sorry to hear about the lindsay thing and how hard its hitting you. I just want you to know that we're all here for you. I know that for the next couple of weeks or months it's going to suck. All I can say is that there's a light at the end of everything you're experiencing right now. I personally went through the same thing last year with my ex. I know only a few of you know but It was one of the hardest times of my life, my grades suffered, I wasnt eating and lost 20 lbs, I thought the depression was never going to end. However all of you guys helped me get back on my feet and remember to have fun and enjoy myself! It made me realize I wasn't alone as you guys were all with me all I had to do was reach out. The reason I'm mentioning my experience is that it just takes time and you will come out of this stronger then you were before! Remember to focus on yourself and do things that you enjoy! Feel free to message me or call me if you ever want. I'm always open to talk. Cant wait to see you when we get back!
[11/9/18, 12:43:43 PM] Dev Naik: Thank you Joe, the words help a lot. Appreciate your friendship and time, I’m excited to see you when I get back
[11/9/18, 2:01:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: Everyone’s basically said everything lmao. But Dev, Deas ass EVERYTHING happens for a reason. Even though we may not see the reason at first, and although it is probably rough as fucking shit, for some reason your suppose to take this journey. It takes hitting rock bottom, to really work on your self and rebuild in ways you never could have imagined, ways better than you were before. Because when you hit rock bottom the only way to go is up! You have so much to offer, so much positivity so much visión so much determination and so much sexy and it’s just a matter of you coming back to that realization. I believe god gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. So soldier, don’t be afraid to be weak, often that’s our biggest fear coming across as weak. But that’s how we all start. And from there the possibilities of growth are endlesss. I’m excited too see what’s coming for you Dev, they are going to be HUUUGE.

[11/13/18, 3:28:41 PM] Chase Larsen: Alright guys, I fly out to Utah tonight at 9pm and then I enter the training center tomorrow. After that I won’t have this phone. I talked a little to Owen and I think we might be able to set up a google hangout that way I can still sort of text you guys. But just wanted to tell you all that you’re awesome and have been the best friends I could ask for. I can’t wait to see you all in 2 and see how far everybody has gone with life. Love you all ✌🏼
[11/13/18, 3:30:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You wont have a phone?
[11/13/18, 3:30:57 PM] Dustin Bradley: Love ya brotha take care man you will be missed greatly
[11/13/18, 3:33:02 PM] Chase Larsen: I will, but there are restrictions, so like I won’t have Snapchat, what’s app, instagram, I might have Facebook. And I usually only have one day to email
[11/13/18, 3:33:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That seems strange to me
[11/13/18, 3:34:31 PM] Chase Larsen: That’s mission rules, they want you completely focused on missionary work
[11/13/18, 3:34:46 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Interesting. TIL
[11/13/18, 3:41:07 PM] Chris Cheng: Gunna miss you Chase! Have a safe flight and stay safe on your mission!
[11/13/18, 3:42:01 PM] Owen Gilbert: Chase it was good to see you one last time man. Hope you have an amazing time and that chat will be up soon, also just wanted to mention to you guys as well, alana and I broke up as well, literally happened the day before dev texted so it felt weird to mention as well. But dev im sorry man and I 100% feel where you're at. Been the longest toughest week ever and it sucks. And I know I barely talk in the chat but I do miss you guys, now more than ever too, and you too chase, love you man

[11/13/18, 4:22:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: Owen. I’m so sorry Bro. That’s insane. All I can say is same thing I said to Dev. For whatever reason. This was suppose to happen. And you will grow from it. I mean this so seriously, @19256993454 and @19255960307 Ariana’s new song said it best. She learned a lot from each person, thanked them for those lessons and experience, and on to the next.
[11/13/18, 4:23:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: @18586038907  is it possible to visit you chase?
[11/13/18, 4:23:52 PM] Bryce Olson: I asked him that and he said yes
[11/13/18, 4:24:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And good luck and have a safe flight man. I know you are gunna do great in Salt Lake and you will be missed so freaking much. I can’t wait to visit you hopefully and get to see you grow as a missionary.

Get back on them videos and get your mind right and be strong, because we know you are. We love you man and are here to talk or anything. Just know you aren’t alone.

[11/13/18, 4:28:30 PM] Owen Gilbert: Thanks guys. Love you all
[11/13/18, 4:34:32 PM] Dev Naik: I feel you Owen, but like everyone has said it is a time to reflect on ourselves and be us. Do what makes us happy. Reflect and learn from the past to live in the present in order to make your future. We got this man. I love you bro. Everything that everyone has said is 110% true and I can’t stress it more. Do what you love and take that time for yourself. I know I lost myself trying to make someone else happy, but at the end of the day it’s impossible to make someone else happy if you aren’t happy first. Like I said already man, I love you and we got this❤
[11/13/18, 4:37:33 PM] Dev Naik: And Chase I’m going to miss you so much man! I’m super excited to see you progress to another aspect of your life. You are going to kill in salt lake and it’s going to be fun to see what life will throw out ways within the time you are there! Obviously we will email to stay in touch and you know I will have to make a trip out to Salt Lake City!! Love you man and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors!! Can’t wait to see you soon!!❤
[11/13/18, 4:43:30 PM] Chase Larsen: Thanks guys! You are all amazing, and to answer the question of visiting, yes you can visit me if you make it out to salt lake. That would be really awesome. Obviously you couldn’t visit like every month but that doesn’t matter because you guys are all busy so come visit me some time in salt lake. Just email me like a week before if you do and we can figure it out
[11/13/18, 4:44:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Is there any other specifics we should know like an address a phone number or like anything?
[11/13/18, 4:44:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What part of salt lake
[11/13/18, 4:50:07 PM] Chase Larsen: I transfer around the salt lake area so my emails will tell you where I am

[11/26/18, 12:48:33 AM] Owen Gilbert: I'm personally not a fan of razor, but the chroma keyboard is pretty decent out of their lineup
[11/26/18, 12:48:38 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Gotchu
[11/26/18, 12:48:38 AM] Joe Stine: Personally though I would go the extra cash and buy a keyboard with cherry mechanical switches if you ever do plan to game with a keyboard.
[11/26/18, 12:48:49 AM] Joe Stine: Yeah black widow chroma is ok
[11/26/18, 12:49:16 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean I won’t game with it, because I don’t have a PC yet so just want a keyboard that’s not shit. And RGB
[11/26/18, 12:49:32 AM] Mohit Veligenti: If anything
[11/26/18, 12:49:53 AM] Owen Gilbert: For that price point I can see it being good, cause the keyboard joe and i have is like 150 lol
[11/26/18, 12:50:16 AM] Joe Stine: PC master race
[11/26/18, 12:51:41 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah

[11/26/18, 12:54:12 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Mohit doesn’t know what the different switches are
[11/26/18, 12:54:23 AM] Mohit Veligenti: He shall look it up and hit you back up

[11/26/18, 12:56:00 AM] Owen Gilbert: Cause like Joe said theres cherry red switches, speed switches, brown and red switches, they all do different things/feel different, just gotta see which one you prefer
[11/26/18, 12:56:15 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I need the quietest one possible so imma look for that one. I hate the sound of loud keyboards
[11/26/18, 12:56:22 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahh gotchu
[11/26/18, 12:57:49 AM] Owen Gilbert: Look up like cherry silent switches cause there are mechanical keyboards that are like dead quiet
[11/26/18, 1:04:36 AM] Joe Stine: If you want I can sell you my old corsair keyboard with cherry MX silents cause I'm switching it out with a new one I bought lol.

[12/3/18, 1:04:34 AM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahahaha stfu
[12/3/18, 1:04:56 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Here is a translation @19259980019: Tell me why a woman would hate a man, who said Ariana’s music video wasn’t good, more than she would hate Bret Kavanagh
[12/3/18, 1:06:08 AM] Cameron Freeman: Okay let me re phrase everything
[12/3/18, 1:07:05 AM] Cameron Freeman: Tell me why, I feel as though if a man were to hate on Ariana’s “than u next” music video, a woman would hate him more than a man who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman
[12/3/18, 1:10:44 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Wow! Some people are so caught up in their ideology that they don’t stop, and think how stupid it all sounds

[12/3/18, 1:21:27 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I didn’t want to say women and think I was excluding them. Anybody can fall into this trap
[12/3/18, 1:25:53 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Because people are stupid and support dumb shit.
[12/3/18, 1:26:06 AM] Mohit Veligenti: So you right
[12/3/18, 1:26:24 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Not just women, but some men too
[12/3/18, 1:27:54 AM] Mohit Veligenti: This is going extreme, but it’s kinda like how some women are SO anti rape against women and would literally kill a man who did it, but when someone says a man was raped, half of them won’t say anything or would say “men can’t be raped”. People are dumb as shit and support dumb ideologies.
[12/3/18, 1:28:27 AM] Cameron Freeman: Truuuuuuuuuuuuue

[12/23/18, 2:12:29 PM] Dev Naik: https://goo.gl/images/BDt6JT
[12/23/18, 2:13:58 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: How it that Game of Thrones themed?
[12/23/18, 2:14:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: If someone told me those were Bengals themed or Garfield themed I would believe them
[12/23/18, 2:15:07 PM] Dev Naik: Read up on it
[12/23/18, 2:16:25 PM] Dev Naik: I haven’t read the reason yet besides it being a collab and that fact that it looks 🔥
[12/23/18, 2:17:12 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Looks lame not enough GOT
[12/23/18, 2:18:46 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: You can replace the heal tag with “lasagna” and you got a Garfield shoe
[12/23/18, 2:19:23 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I hope they do a better job with the other houses
[12/23/18, 2:20:13 PM] Dev Naik: It’s a collab bruh... it’s meant to be a shoe that people want to wear that has a meaning with the show and has exclusivity
[12/23/18, 2:20:54 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I know what a collab is. I’m just saying it doesn’t stand out to me. It’s lacking the GOT theme imo
[12/23/18, 2:21:19 PM] Dev Naik: I think the colorway looks great, it’s not supposed to be up in your face with got
[12/23/18, 2:22:44 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ya but if you didnt tell me it was GOT I would have never guessed. I mean maybe throw in a house banner here or there. I feel like there’s a lot of room for creativity
[12/23/18, 2:23:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I agree with Tim lowkey
[12/23/18, 2:23:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It can be a collab for any basketball player and I would’ve said oh yeah
[12/23/18, 2:24:20 PM] Dev Naik: It’s meant to be an exclusive shoe with some meaning behind its colorway and isn’t supposed to take away from the ultra boost
[12/23/18, 2:24:32 PM] Dev Naik: Sure their could have been more done but the colorway looks sick
[12/23/18, 2:25:16 PM] Dev Naik: Their could always be more done but there is tons that goes into the design process
[12/23/18, 2:30:22 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Of course but at the end of the day, it’s underwhelming at best and that’s coming from a GOT fan
[12/23/18, 2:31:04 PM] Dev Naik: The goal of the shoe isn’t supposed to overwhelm the shoe with got
[12/23/18, 2:31:20 PM] Dev Naik: You have your opinion tho
[12/23/18, 2:31:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Why don’t we just knock it down to it’s personal preference and devs feelin and Timmy’s not
[12/23/18, 2:32:21 PM] Dev Naik: Yes haha
[12/23/18, 2:33:32 PM] Dev Naik: I was always saying that it looks sick as a colorway not the fact it’s  a got theme
[12/23/18, 2:34:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: In a weird sick turn of events I too am going to have to agree with Timmy
[12/23/18, 2:35:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Woah what

[12/27/18, 8:23:58 PM] Dev Naik: It requires no work at all
[12/27/18, 8:24:29 PM] Dev Naik: Because that way maybe people who didn’t sign up for secret Santa can also be a part of it if they wish
[12/27/18, 8:28:23 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I think people already got speisific gifts for their person. I know I did so my present wouldn’t work for anyone else

[12/27/18, 8:29:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: Truuuuue

[12/27/18, 8:30:33 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: So if everyone did that then everyone would pick there own presents. That’s just secret santa lmao
[12/27/18, 8:31:10 PM] Dev Naik: Did everyone sign up for secret Santa
[12/27/18, 8:31:24 PM] Dev Naik: Or nah?
[12/27/18, 8:32:08 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Pretty much everybody did
[12/27/18, 8:32:10 PM] Dev Naik: Because I’m just thinking that if some people didn’t sign up and want to be a part of it
[12/27/18, 8:32:18 PM] Dev Naik: I feel like some domies didn’t

[12/27/18, 8:37:12 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I’m saying it’s a bad reason. A good reason would be something like let’s make a white elephant so everybody at the party can be a part of it

[12/27/18, 8:39:40 PM] Dev Naik: All of ha domies

[12/30/18, 12:14:44 PM] Dev Naik: We should just put them all in pile  and one by one open them. Only have the name of who it’s for on there and not who it’s from
[12/30/18, 12:15:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: Bet
[12/30/18, 12:17:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh yeah that’s good too
[12/30/18, 12:44:48 PM] Cameron Freeman: Tell me how that was a touchdown
[12/30/18, 12:45:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: He flew that was crazy doe. He literally super maned that’s hoe. But that dumb he got the ball hit out of his hand what rule is that
[12/30/18, 12:46:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The ball was crossed the line when it got knocked out
[12/30/18, 12:46:16 PM] Dev Naik: It broke the plane
[12/30/18, 12:46:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: As soon as it crosses the line, its a td and the play is over
[12/30/18, 12:46:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s dumb then if that were the logic when people fall to the ground after the touchdown the ball shouldn’t have to be contained
[12/30/18, 12:46:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: You know what I’m saying
[12/30/18, 12:47:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It has to be in possession first. He had full possession into the line
[12/30/18, 12:47:18 PM] Cameron Freeman: 2 feet in, has ball. Touchdown. But no if you drop it out of bounds it’s not a touchdown
[12/30/18, 12:47:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s dumb
[12/30/18, 12:47:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: When you catch it, you have to have possession. Thats different ruling
[12/30/18, 12:47:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It wouldnt be a fumble, it would be incomplete
[12/30/18, 12:48:42 PM] Joe Stine: Speaking of fumblea
[12/30/18, 12:48:46 PM] Joe Stine: Fumbles*

[1/4/19, 12:43:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But like, dawg, it seems like every 3 he takes. He’s jumping off someone and pushing off to create space. It just feels cheap. I don’t know if it’s legal or nah but it just feels like dumb
[1/4/19, 12:45:36 PM] Joe Stine: Yeah but on the last 3 to win the game shouldve been an and 1, also warriors shouldve never gone up by 2 KD was out of bounds on the save.
[1/4/19, 12:45:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Almost as legal as durant’s “save”

[1/21/19, 6:32:48 PM] Dev Naik: Times have changed and we have had better instruments to conduct experiments to look into the past and have officially confirmed that ape belongs on the ape family
[1/21/19, 6:34:34 PM] Dev Naik: Just look at the glorious beast. With the wits of a chimpanzee, the body of a gorilla, and the kind heart of a bonobo, he clearly is related to them and is part of the larger ape family

[1/30/19, 11:53:52 AM] Cameron Freeman: That’s what I was thinking they hella wouldn’t have done that for the chargers lmao
[1/30/19, 11:54:25 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Lmao they def would not have
[1/30/19, 12:03:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think most true LA fans hate the chargers still and have always been rams or raiders fans
[1/30/19, 2:27:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yessss or cowboys Hahhaa
[1/31/19, 1:01:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m very scared
[1/31/19, 1:01:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: For the next few weeks in the NBA
[1/31/19, 1:01:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kristaps to Mavs? For who tho
[1/31/19, 1:02:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Apparently the knicks want kd
[1/31/19, 1:02:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: Three people got traded from each team including deondre Jordan
[1/31/19, 1:02:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: The lakers just proposed a 4 person trade for AD including lonzo wtf
[1/31/19, 1:02:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Holy shit i just saw that
[1/31/19, 1:02:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s so dumb
[1/31/19, 1:03:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Knicks lowkey just won that trade
[1/31/19, 1:03:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah Forreal
[1/31/19, 1:03:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: And kirie is saying he wants to be Lebron a teammate again

[1/31/19, 1:04:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t think Kyrie ACTUALLY wants to go
[1/31/19, 1:04:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: I think he does
[1/31/19, 1:04:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I saw something like, if Kyrie said he’s interested
[1/31/19, 1:04:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: I read an article about it
[1/31/19, 1:04:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Then lakers would focus on him and AD until the deadline
[1/31/19, 1:04:46 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And then Celtics can put all their chips in for AD
[1/31/19, 1:04:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: What
[1/31/19, 1:05:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: We tryna get both lol
[1/31/19, 1:05:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t know it was something I read not too sure
[1/31/19, 1:05:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I haven’t been keeping up too much
[1/31/19, 1:05:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: And then we bout to get out 17th championship
[1/31/19, 1:06:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Three way trade between lakers celtics and pelicans?
[1/31/19, 1:06:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: This can happen yes
[1/31/19, 1:07:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So kyrie and ad for their entire depth lol
[1/31/19, 1:08:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Honestly, i think the lakers should go for a lower valued big man

[1/31/19, 1:23:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Whats wrong with looney
‎[1/31/19, 1:29:55 PM] Joe Stine: ‎image omitted
[1/31/19, 1:30:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He still plays the 5 fairly well
[1/31/19, 1:30:41 PM] Cameron Freeman: No his team plays very well
[1/31/19, 1:30:45 PM] Joe Stine: Only cause hes on the warriors.
[1/31/19, 1:30:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: Put him on any other team
[1/31/19, 1:30:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exaclty
[1/31/19, 1:30:51 PM] Joe Stine: Lmao
[1/31/19, 1:30:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And I am sure he would do decently enough
[1/31/19, 1:31:24 PM] Joe Stine: 🤔
[1/31/19, 2:04:37 PM] Chris Cheng: I thought pelicans are waiting it out past the deadline
[1/31/19, 2:05:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: That’s dumb honestly. If your player says they want to be traded you shouldn’t keep them that means they are really even fighting for that team anymore it’s a bad look
[1/31/19, 2:06:35 PM] Chris Cheng: But the pelicans are just being conservative and dont wanna rush into a decision too quickly
[1/31/19, 2:08:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah that’s true
[1/31/19, 2:11:09 PM] Chris Cheng: Id be surprised if they actually trade him before the deadline
[1/31/19, 2:44:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They already removed him from their hype videos
[1/31/19, 4:47:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The knicks also sent Trey Burke? Bruh
[2/1/19, 10:08:49 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kyrie and AD to knicks?
[2/1/19, 10:08:58 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: If they survive the trade deadline
[2/1/19, 10:01:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: THE STUPIDEST TRADE WTF
[2/1/19, 10:01:17 PM] Cameron Freeman: LAKERS ARE IDIOTS
[2/1/19, 10:01:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: WTFF
[2/1/19, 10:03:40 PM] Cameron Freeman: LONZO, KUZMA, RONDO, BEASLEY, AND FIRST ROUND PIC
[2/1/19, 10:07:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: For AD?
[2/1/19, 10:08:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats just an offer
[2/1/19, 10:10:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s a dumb offer damn
[2/1/19, 10:10:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: 4 players and a first round for a big man?
[2/1/19, 10:10:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah but it’s stupid
[2/1/19, 10:10:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: Our two point guards
[2/1/19, 10:10:32 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Oh 100%
[2/1/19, 10:10:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Rondo is a great point guard and he is good for the team
[2/1/19, 10:10:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lonzo also and he’s our future
[2/1/19, 10:10:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[2/1/19, 10:10:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m sorry
[2/1/19, 10:10:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Still got lance
[2/1/19, 10:10:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s a good one
[2/1/19, 10:11:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m sorry I hate on lonzo because his dad
[2/1/19, 10:11:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Very unfair but highly funny
[2/1/19, 10:11:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: Kuzma is a beast and scores all our points
[2/1/19, 10:11:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah I don’t like his dad but u should not not like him because of his dad
[2/1/19, 10:12:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh no I just shit on him because of it
[2/1/19, 10:12:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s not that I don’t like him
[2/1/19, 10:12:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s just that I think he’s not that amazing of a player and he’s slightly overrated in the league. SLIGHTLY
[2/1/19, 10:12:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: I disagree that he’s overrated
[2/1/19, 10:12:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: I recommend watching some games

[2/1/19, 10:14:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah true
[2/1/19, 10:14:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean i don’t know
[2/1/19, 10:14:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I count kuzma as a main
[2/1/19, 10:14:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nope. Imma be stubborn and stick to my old ways
[2/1/19, 10:15:14 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I honestly think he is overrated. Solid player, but not insane like he is made out to be
[2/1/19, 10:16:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahh I see

[2/16/19, 3:03:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Try to find the equation online
[2/16/19, 3:03:58 PM] Dustin Bradley: That’s what I was thinking two but was unsure

[3/3/19, 9:31:04 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ok Dustin this is what you do
[3/3/19, 9:31:22 PM] Joe Stine: You unplug your router

[3/3/19, 9:32:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: The funny thing is she think she’s actually coding this software is for preschoolers
[3/3/19, 9:32:52 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I’m just fucking with you don’t type that into terminal

[3/3/19, 9:36:55 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin tell her to come do my computer vision lab and then say “anyone can code”
[3/3/19, 9:37:53 PM] Joe Stine: Basically what tim said. "Sudo" gives root access, "rm" remove, -rf "recursively" delete directories, "/" the top most file so every file lol.
[3/3/19, 9:38:24 PM] Joe Stine: But if I can print out hello world I can code REEEEEEEEEE
[3/3/19, 9:40:20 PM] Dustin Bradley: Dude I know this shit takes years off schooling and she thinks she can learn it over one night
[3/3/19, 9:41:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I wanna see what code.org is.
[3/3/19, 9:41:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Also depends on which course she’s doing
[3/3/19, 9:41:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because there’s 3 levels. K-5, 6-12, and k-12
[3/3/19, 9:41:59 PM] Dustin Bradley: Mohit I guarantee the next time we see each other my mom will say she knows how to code
[3/3/19, 9:42:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Beyond k-12*
[3/3/19, 9:42:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And imma make her feel real bad by shutting that shit down
[3/3/19, 9:42:29 PM] Joe Stine: Guaranteed
[3/3/19, 9:42:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I will crush dreams if I have to
[3/3/19, 9:42:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m probably gunna ask her what language she learned and she’ll not know the answer. Watch lol
[3/3/19, 9:43:11 PM] Joe Stine: I learned code m8.
[3/3/19, 9:43:14 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Wait what language is she learning?

[3/3/19, 9:43:22 PM] Joe Stine: Code
[3/3/19, 9:43:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I think it’s like scratch or those building block coding things
[3/3/19, 9:44:22 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its prob a learning psuedocode
[3/3/19, 9:44:30 PM] Dustin Bradley: And ya man you probably right but what if I was the robot “I Robot”
[3/3/19, 9:44:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Huh?
[3/3/19, 9:44:49 PM] Dustin Bradley: Fake
[3/3/19, 9:45:02 PM] Dustin Bradley: Or false
[3/3/19, 9:45:29 PM] Joe Stine: 🤔
[3/3/19, 9:45:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Like you follow a psuedocode, not actual coding
[3/3/19, 9:45:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh
[3/3/19, 9:45:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Gotchu
[3/3/19, 9:45:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Probably yeah. Like a scratch type of shit

[3/4/19, 12:03:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: Guys. I have something very serious to say! 100% I know we could do it and I would appreciate an open mind and genuine consideration.
[3/4/19, 12:04:50 PM] Joe Stine: 🤔
[3/4/19, 12:06:32 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its okay that you are gay, we still love you
[3/4/19, 12:08:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: I have one more semester after this semester where I need just 15 random units to graduate. I have decided to study abroad one more time in Bangkok, Thailand Fall 2019. Thailand is literally stupid ass cheap. And they also go super super hard for New Years! Along with other south east Asia countries. I say. We all start saving up. If we don’t have a passport we start the process of getting one. If u buy early enough a roundtrip ticket could be $400-500 I checked. And then we could celebrate New Years in friken Thailand or even Tokyo because i know we were all talking about taking a trip together and going to Tokyo. Wouldn’t that be stupid lit if we all celebrated it over there? Majority of you who are in school is graduating this semester what better way to celebrate the new year
[3/4/19, 12:09:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That would be lit, but I can’t because I have two semesters left with required upper divs
[3/4/19, 12:10:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: It would be winter break! When we are out of school
[3/4/19, 12:11:13 PM] Chris Cheng: That’d be dope! I wanna see the headcount first tho before i make any decisions
[3/4/19, 12:11:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ofcourse yeah
[3/4/19, 12:12:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: -We all have so much time to save up
- we have time to request work off
- we don’t have school during that time
-we are billionaires over there

Let’s fucking go guys
[3/4/19, 12:12:30 PM] Dustin Bradley: Cam that’s sounds awesome as shit but most of us are broke as fuck and saving up money in that short of time is unrealistic but I’ll try my best to save up
[3/4/19, 12:12:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: That short of time? It’s March right now. That would Be December lol
[3/4/19, 12:13:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its actually not that bad @19257847841
[3/4/19, 12:13:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I can’t go still. It will be my first Christmas with my parents separated, I can’t leave
[3/4/19, 12:13:52 PM] Joe Stine: Id be graduating that Semester so it depends on current job situation. I also plan on going to Japan for a month or so Summer 2020 so ill have to see if I have enough money saved
[3/4/19, 12:14:32 PM] Joe Stine: Thailand though 😏
[3/4/19, 12:14:34 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ahhhhh I see
[3/4/19, 12:14:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: Forsure!
[3/4/19, 12:15:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Same I’d wanna see how everything is with y’all beforehand
[3/4/19, 12:15:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But I would be down for Tokyo for sure
[3/4/19, 12:16:32 PM] Dustin Bradley: Guys I’m saying the likelyhood of us all going to Thailand for New Years is a stretch life happens people’s destinations and destinies change its not just one straight line to the finish
[3/4/19, 12:16:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: Sorry bro I 100% disagree
[3/4/19, 12:16:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dude. That is why he is proposing it now
[3/4/19, 12:17:15 PM] Dustin Bradley: I know but I’m saying plans change
[3/4/19, 12:17:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats why you set the plan
[3/4/19, 12:17:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not if we make them set!
[3/4/19, 12:17:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin, it’s a hard thing to do. Doesn’t mean it’s impossible. All of us going is hard as fuck but we can TRY to make it work
[3/4/19, 12:17:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: We just have to have a good attitude about it
[3/4/19, 12:18:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: I think it’s all about our mentality. We all just have to realIze how doable it is it’s seriously so do able
[3/4/19, 12:18:13 PM] Joe Stine: Dustin is just scared of noodles
[3/4/19, 12:18:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: No I get it
[3/4/19, 12:18:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Double meaning, I like
[3/4/19, 12:19:55 PM] Dustin Bradley: I planned to do a spartan Race with Dustin Duranleau almost one year ago from today and guess what he’s going to a concert/Race with Ally Johnson on the day of that race which is this month
[3/4/19, 12:20:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: Bro thats because he’s not reliable and weak
[3/4/19, 12:20:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m being dead ass. And we all can make this our plan and stick to it. We put money down every week or month and make it real bro you just can’t have that attitude
[3/4/19, 12:21:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s because he’s got a girl
[3/4/19, 12:21:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You can’t trust a man when he’s willing to let go of everything for a girl
[3/4/19, 12:21:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like letting go of EVERYTHING
[3/4/19, 12:21:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: He fucking moves to LA for a girl wtf
[3/4/19, 12:22:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: He’s doing the same thing with ally he’s moving to Reno 😳
[3/4/19, 12:22:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: Point proven don’t ever use him for an argument again
[3/4/19, 12:23:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yeah why would you use him as an anecdote
[3/4/19, 12:23:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: YEAH
[3/4/19, 12:23:17 PM] Dustin Bradley: 😐😐 FUCK
[3/4/19, 12:23:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah*
[3/4/19, 12:23:31 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats like saying I saw a rat eat an ant once so a rat could kill a lion singlehandedly
[3/4/19, 12:23:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s the worst example
[3/4/19, 12:23:40 PM] Chris Cheng: Lol
[3/4/19, 12:23:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s like saying my friend killed someone, so I know all my friends will murder someone
[3/4/19, 12:24:33 PM] Dustin Bradley: Because at that time almost a year ago from now I thought he was my friend but I guess time changes people the do I know anymore
[3/4/19, 12:24:45 PM] Cameron Freeman: It sounds to me everyone’s down if everyone’s down
[3/4/19, 12:24:47 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Can we get F in the chat for Dustin
[3/4/19, 12:24:59 PM] Dustin Bradley: F*

[3/4/19, 12:29:36 PM] Joe Stine: The real id is the new id you need to fly domestic in us starting next year i think. Otherwise you need a passport
[3/4/19, 12:29:41 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: “Real ID thing”
[3/4/19, 12:29:42 PM] Dustin Bradley: No that’s what its called Its called the real ID and act as a passport
[3/4/19, 12:29:55 PM] Joe Stine: It doesnt act as a passport.
[3/4/19, 12:30:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s not a passport
[3/4/19, 12:30:14 PM] Joe Stine: Its so you can fly domestic u.s. without a passport.
[3/4/19, 12:30:16 PM] Dustin Bradley: Wait you being sarcastic
[3/4/19, 12:30:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Other countries don’t accept it
[3/4/19, 12:30:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You still need a US passport so you have your visa
[3/4/19, 12:30:46 PM] Dustin Bradley: Okay
[3/4/19, 12:30:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The Real ID is the horizontal 21-yr old id
[3/4/19, 12:31:00 PM] Cameron Freeman: No dead ass you need a US passport to leave the US and come back and you need the Real ID to travel within the US and if u don’t have a Real ID you will need to use a passport. Does that make sense?
[3/4/19, 12:31:54 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The fact that Dustin doesn’t know he needs a US passport to leave the country means he needs to travel
[3/4/19, 12:32:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exaclty.
[3/4/19, 12:32:23 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Dustin have you ever left the US?

[3/4/19, 12:34:28 PM] Jonathan Ong: If u leave the US, u have to have a passport. Within the US, u only need the real ID. Get both like everyone else is saying
[3/4/19, 12:34:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You are supposed to get a real ID like 6 months or something after you turn 21

[4/1/19, 1:57:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You did today’s workout?
[4/1/19, 2:00:22 PM] Dustin Bradley: Yessss and it’s working I feel like my squat has improved after you gave me advice on how to improve it
[4/1/19, 2:19:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lit dude! I’m glad it helped man.
[4/1/19, 2:19:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Week 5 is fucking crazy
[4/1/19, 2:19:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Well kinda
[4/1/19, 2:22:47 PM] Dustin Bradley: I don’t wanna look 👀
[4/1/19, 2:24:45 PM] Dustin Bradley: I struggled with the Bulgarian split squat it sucked the energy out of me
[4/1/19, 2:26:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeahh and that shit sucks.

[4/1/19, 3:39:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Down dude
[4/1/19, 3:55:26 PM] Dev Naik: Yo also I’ll need to know if anyone does plan on driving up to my graduation
[4/1/19, 3:55:53 PM] Dev Naik: Better we figure that out now so I can get the tickets needed
[4/1/19, 3:57:50 PM] Dev Naik: Also if we plan on calling chase tonight I’m in class from 6:40-9:30
[4/1/19, 4:02:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m hoping people still down. I was down. I’ll keep you updated tho
[4/1/19, 4:02:50 PM] Dev Naik: For sure, also my dad is going to be driving up with my grandparents and my sister if y’all wanted to maybe squeeze in with them that’s a possibility
[4/1/19, 4:04:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Hmm. Maybe.
[4/1/19, 4:09:17 PM] Dev Naik: But they aren’t coming early at all so that’s the downside, the earlier y’all come the more we get to do in Portland
[4/1/19, 4:09:37 PM] Dev Naik: I’m also gonna be in Portland for a little bit after so whatever works really
[4/1/19, 4:10:07 PM] Dev Naik: It would be cool to have y’all in Portland haha
[4/1/19, 4:11:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah I was trying to say drive up early
[4/1/19, 4:12:02 PM] Dev Naik: Ya
[4/1/19, 4:13:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe we could get a hotel or something and do whatever
[4/1/19, 4:13:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If people are down
[4/1/19, 4:15:43 PM] Dev Naik: Or just crash at my place
[4/1/19, 4:15:55 PM] Dev Naik: Cuz it’s free that way
[4/1/19, 4:16:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wouldn’t it be kinda cramped?
[4/1/19, 4:16:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t mind getting one hotel room for all of us to crash at
[4/1/19, 4:16:27 PM] Dev Naik: It’s bigger than a hotel room
[4/1/19, 4:16:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh fosho
[4/1/19, 4:16:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright might be better then
[4/1/19, 4:16:44 PM] Dev Naik: I live in an apartment now, not the dorms

[4/7/19, 4:11:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I love how to east is like, just win more games than you lose
[4/7/19, 4:12:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Or just even .500
[4/7/19, 4:12:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean it’s only last place that’s not .500 or above lol
[4/7/19, 4:12:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Also, Lakers go to the playoffs? @19258955572
[4/7/19, 4:13:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I didn’t see the standings
[4/7/19, 4:14:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Well we could still go 500, pistons can win two and go 500, and the magic currently are 500
[4/7/19, 4:14:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The west required 47, the east required 40
[4/7/19, 4:15:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Therefore, east is more competitive

[4/8/19, 2:34:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because imma start working. And i would be possibly down for another trip during New Years to Thailand. But I was hoping to do a boys trip before starting to work
[4/8/19, 2:34:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because I know I’ll get busy af probably
[4/8/19, 2:34:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sorta

[4/8/19, 2:48:10 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: If you really want to do a boys trip we should go to rent out a house in Tahoe and live it up at the lake. Less expensive, more people could go
[4/8/19, 2:49:04 PM] Dev Naik: I mean it’s a good point but it would be so cool to travel abroad somewhere
[4/8/19, 2:49:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean we could always do that tho. I would be down to do it too just so more people can go. But I also wanna travel
[4/8/19, 2:49:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe. But what would you wanna do in Brazil?
[4/8/19, 2:50:06 PM] Dev Naik: I’ve been wanting to go to Brazil for a while. And a whole bunch of stuff haha..

[4/8/19, 2:51:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cameron. English. Please lol
[4/8/19, 2:51:41 PM] Dev Naik: I have done a bunch of research on what I want to do and the cities I would love to go
[4/8/19, 2:51:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fosho fosho
[4/8/19, 2:52:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe we can talk on Friday or something and figure out ideas?
[4/8/19, 2:52:24 PM] Dev Naik: I just don’t have too much time to go over it now lol

[4/8/19, 2:53:03 PM] Dev Naik: And possibly! Depends on what time for Friday
[4/8/19, 2:53:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because I don’t wanna just chill at home after I graduate lol
[4/8/19, 2:53:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lit
[4/8/19, 2:55:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And japan New Years means we wouldn’t be able to do AS much stuff since we won’t be able to stay as long and it would be more packed.
[4/8/19, 2:55:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: What?
[4/8/19, 2:55:33 PM] Dev Naik: I feel like that’s the same everywhere tho
[4/8/19, 2:55:42 PM] Cameron Freeman: Why would we not be able to stay as long?
[4/8/19, 2:55:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: So ur saying Thailand?
[4/8/19, 2:55:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Chris and I will be working...?
[4/8/19, 2:56:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So we can’t take off as much time
[4/8/19, 2:57:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course. But Thailand seems more a New Years spot than japan.
[4/8/19, 3:00:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: @19259980019 I think you are misunderstanding Cameron's original plan
[4/8/19, 3:00:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What was his original plan?
[4/8/19, 3:01:48 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I don't think Cameron ever said he wanted to go to Japan. He just suggested that it could be a possibility while your in Asia. However overall he just wanted us to spend the new year's in Thailand with him
[4/8/19, 3:02:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ohhh I see
[4/8/19, 3:03:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I mean I’m down for Thailand for New Years possibly

[6/5/19, 9:04:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[6/5/19, 9:04:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That may be the min but the admission rates are the issue, not the req
[6/5/19, 9:05:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah it’s not the same as college
[6/5/19, 9:05:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sorry
[6/5/19, 9:05:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s not the same as high school to UCLA transfer.
[6/5/19, 9:05:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I know that went from UCM to UCB as a CS Major. Had a 3.6.  And it’s a lot harder to go from UC to UC
[6/5/19, 9:11:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Wait its harder?
[6/5/19, 9:12:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: UC to UC is harder by far
[6/5/19, 9:12:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because you’re already at a UC
[6/5/19, 9:12:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So they give less priority
[6/6/19, 12:39:01 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Hey this is super random, but I know a lot of you guys are gunna be starting applying or even already applying to jobs. If you want to get your resume checked and looked through or even need to start one, hit me up. I’m free as fuck. And that’s what I did all the time in school for the club I was a part of. And others on here could probably do a look through as well. Just to be able to have another set of eyes before passing it off to employers and shit.
[6/6/19, 12:41:43 AM] Dev Naik: Oh shit thanks bro good shit!!
[6/6/19, 12:41:50 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeee
[6/6/19, 12:42:18 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I wanna see all the homies succeed. And if that means going through like 20 resume revisions. So be it. I did that shit all the time and it’s lowkey kinda fun now.
[6/6/19, 12:42:20 AM] Dev Naik: And same goes to anyone who is making a portfolio, I don’t know if any of you are lol but I got y’all if you need some eyes or some help!
[6/6/19, 12:42:22 AM] Mohit Veligenti: So bother me all you want

[6/6/19, 12:42:43 AM] Mohit Veligenti: For the portfolio
[6/6/19, 12:43:14 AM] Dev Naik: Yups! I’m used to architecture portfolios but any sorts of visuals I can do my best to help!

[6/6/19, 2:33:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: You guys should visit Portland or San Francisco
[6/6/19, 2:33:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahaha
[6/6/19, 2:33:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im not sure why you think San Jose isnt progressive
[6/6/19, 2:34:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because you and Tim live there
[6/6/19, 2:34:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: *assuming I am not progressive
[6/6/19, 2:34:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exhibit A
[6/6/19, 2:34:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exhibit B
[6/6/19, 2:35:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The only people offended by that word are people who think it is offensive. Has a mentally handicapped person ever told you that the word is offensive?
[6/6/19, 2:36:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes
[6/6/19, 2:36:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m with them right now would you like me to put them on the phone?
[6/6/19, 2:36:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yep, please do
[6/6/19, 2:37:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: Why did u decline the phone call
[6/6/19, 2:37:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Are you calling me retarded? That is hypocritical
[6/6/19, 2:37:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: What
[6/6/19, 2:37:44 PM] Cameron Freeman: I asked if u would like me to put them on the phone . Meaning I’d call u and they would talk to you
[6/6/19, 2:37:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: But u declined the phone call lol
[6/6/19, 2:38:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Them, being a mentally handicapped person
[6/6/19, 2:38:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes
[6/6/19, 2:39:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So therefore, it isnt offensive, because I said so. If I am as you say I am, then I can make that distinction
[6/6/19, 2:39:21 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lol what
[6/6/19, 2:40:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You say I am mentally handicapped, therefore I can say retarded isnt offensive. Checkmate
[6/6/19, 2:40:16 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lol no one ever said you were mentally handicapped Hahahaa
[6/6/19, 2:40:30 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Getting offended at the word retarded is retarded
[6/6/19, 2:41:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahah omg forget it I was just messing I thought this was a run on joke saying “that’s so San Jose” and I just added Merced and Reno this time
[6/6/19, 2:41:39 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I am offended by your hurtful words of San Jose
[6/6/19, 2:41:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: But Ethan.i don’t get why u don’t get what I’m saying lol
[6/6/19, 2:41:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I misread what you said
[6/6/19, 2:42:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: You asked if a mentally handicapped person has told me it’s offensive. And I said yes they are with me right now would you like to speak to them so they can tell you it’s offensive ? And u saidnyes, and I called and u declined lol
[6/6/19, 2:42:12 PM] Cameron Freeman: U get me how?
[6/6/19, 2:42:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: Now*
[6/6/19, 2:42:23 PM] Dustin Bradley: I’m Ooffended
[6/6/19, 2:42:28 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Wait what is a San Jose, Reno, and Mercedes way of thinking. That the word "owner" is racist
[6/6/19, 2:42:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes
[6/6/19, 2:42:33 PM] Cameron Freeman: But now I have concluded you are in fact mentally handicapped hahaha
[6/6/19, 2:42:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Checkmate

[6/6/19, 2:45:35 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: @19258955572 do agree though that removing the title "owner" of a team becuase its "racist" is stupid?
[6/6/19, 2:49:59 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He about to say no just to prove his point
[6/6/19, 2:51:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: What point?
[6/6/19, 2:52:02 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Oh ya that SF is "progressive"
[6/6/19, 2:52:13 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^
[6/6/19, 2:53:09 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I'm honestly interested in the argument
[6/6/19, 3:36:50 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He aint gonna respond
[6/6/19, 3:46:24 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Because there is no argument
[6/6/19, 4:05:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He has no standing
[6/6/19, 4:06:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because it’s all based on emotion not fact
[6/6/19, 4:07:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: With no purpose.
[6/6/19, 4:07:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Also dev hasn’t said anything, so just making assumptions that dev is gunna agree.
[6/6/19, 4:07:30 PM] Joe Stine: 🤡ing right now
[6/6/19, 6:00:18 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes!
[6/6/19, 6:00:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: Woah chill I’m at work omg hahaha

[6/6/19, 6:00:57 PM] Cameron Freeman: Everybody calm down
[6/6/19, 6:01:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: That is very stupid
[6/6/19, 6:12:15 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Glad we can all agree for once
[6/6/19, 7:31:37 PM] Dev Naik: I was in class and then had a meeting. I can’t believe you would just assume... I’m offended you assumed my stance on the situation...
[6/6/19, 7:34:45 PM] Dev Naik: I’m playing if you didn’t pick up on that. But seriously I am a firm believer on context. It makes a huge difference
[6/6/19, 7:36:20 PM] Dev Naik: It depends on the situation it is being said in or if it is being used to personally attack or target someone. Some words however kinda like the n word have a history to them and therefore I don’t agree with saying it at all
[6/6/19, 7:36:43 PM] Dev Naik: Ya feel?
[6/6/19, 7:44:54 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao
[6/6/19, 7:47:08 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: What bout using the n word like Quentin Tarintino did to recreate life in the slave era of the US?
[6/6/19, 7:47:24 PM] Dev Naik: That’s chill in my opinion
[6/6/19, 7:48:24 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: What about singing along to a song where an artist uses that word or reading that word in a book?
[6/6/19, 7:48:26 PM] Dev Naik: I’m more so talking in like an everyday setting. In that case it’s meant to recreate that life
[6/6/19, 7:49:09 PM] Dev Naik: The song gets a little iffy to me, for my personal reason, it depends on the artist and their message
[6/6/19, 7:49:54 PM] Dev Naik: If they go out of their way to be like yo don’t say it if you aren’t black then they are pretty much asking you
[6/6/19, 7:51:02 PM] Dev Naik: And in a book again it goes to show what the writer was intending to portray.
[6/6/19, 7:54:04 PM] Dev Naik: I’m also not black, so I feel like I have less of a say on weather people should say the word or not. I just don’t feel comfortable saying it out of context or even just in general
[6/6/19, 7:54:37 PM] Dev Naik: Sorry that’s a lot lmao
[6/6/19, 7:57:05 PM] Dev Naik: Hahahahaha
[6/6/19, 7:57:16 PM] Dev Naik: Damn crazy right... who would have thought
[6/6/19, 8:12:14 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The thing is that wether the word is in a lyric or on a page it is in context. The context is provided by the artist/author and was put there on purpose. Once their art is released to the public for consumption then they can no longer control the use/consumption of their work. To use or not use the word is a suggestion, not law. Wether or not a person chooses to follow the suggestion should be out of their own will to do so. This should not be influenced by society nor law. In the end "bad words" are really just a social construct
[6/6/19, 8:22:34 PM] Dev Naik: It’s not law, and I agree they can’t control who says what. But sometimes they do ask for people not to say it and I respect that decision. The issue really occurs when it comes to people personally targeting someone or a group of people in a negative way. Yes they are able to say what they want but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be looked down upon by society because morally it’s wrong
[6/6/19, 8:38:18 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's fine if you dont want to say it becuase like I said it's your choice. I dont believe in groups targeting individuals for not conforming to a groups "morals" or "beliefs" or "standards".
[6/6/19, 8:40:12 PM] Dev Naik: Agreed
[6/6/19, 8:43:42 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I also think that it's really up the person if they want to say that word in a song and sometimes its probably best not to say it. For example when Kendrick stopped that girl for saying the n-word and asked her not to say it again. She should have not said it after that but she didnt and she faced a negative reaction (Kendrick is still a dick for shitting on her)
[6/6/19, 8:45:52 PM] Dev Naik: Ya it’s hard especially when he asked her to not say it... it is harsh for him to shit on her tho
[6/6/19, 8:46:01 PM] Dev Naik: Could have been handled way better
[6/6/19, 8:57:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What is this
[6/6/19, 8:57:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: A constructive conversation or something? Wtf
[6/6/19, 8:58:09 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Dev is a real progressive whose open to other people's ideas

[6/10/19, 8:15:26 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It aint his calf boys
[6/10/19, 8:19:00 PM] Joe Stine: It looked like his calf it literally explodes in slo mo lol
[6/10/19, 8:19:23 PM] Joe Stine: Probably tore it
[6/10/19, 8:19:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats interesting to wear a boot if it was calf. Achilles sure
[6/10/19, 8:20:07 PM] Joe Stine: Why not both?
[6/10/19, 8:20:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Oof
[6/10/19, 8:23:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Did anyone see that video of Drake when Durant got injured?
[6/10/19, 8:24:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What’d he do
[6/10/19, 8:24:22 PM] Chris Cheng: Iguodala is ass too
[6/10/19, 8:24:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If he did something disrespectful
[6/10/19, 8:24:26 PM] Chris Cheng: Too old

[6/10/19, 8:24:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Can’t blame him
[6/10/19, 8:24:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He was actually super upset
[6/10/19, 8:24:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: At least he’s playing better than players half his age

[6/10/19, 8:31:05 PM] Joe Stine: Congratulations it is now a 3 point game
[6/10/19, 8:33:10 PM] Joe Stine: I dont understand why they took that timeout with two minutes left
[6/10/19, 8:33:29 PM] Joe Stine: They had all the momentum and it gave the warriors a chance to regroup lol
[6/10/19, 8:33:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah lol
[6/10/19, 8:33:46 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That timeout made no sense
[6/10/19, 8:34:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It gives warriors time to cool down from the heat
[6/10/19, 8:37:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Boogie just fucked up
[6/10/19, 8:37:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wow

[6/10/19, 8:38:51 PM] Chris Cheng: F
[6/10/19, 8:38:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Kawhi shut down by iggy and klay, passed to vleet, to lowry in corner and he missed real bad
[6/10/19, 8:39:10 PM] Chris Cheng: They were literally 2 points, 1 basket, to win the championship
[6/10/19, 8:39:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[6/10/19, 8:39:15 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lolllll
[6/10/19, 8:39:18 PM] Chris Cheng: Lowry doing lowry things
[6/10/19, 8:39:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t know why they went for a 3
[6/10/19, 8:39:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course
[6/10/19, 8:39:44 PM] Joe Stine: Still dont know why you call a timeout up 6 two minutes left with all the momentum and the ball
[6/10/19, 8:40:03 PM] Chris Cheng: Yea idgi either
[6/10/19, 8:40:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah

‎[6/12/19, 10:08:34 PM] Owen Gilbert: ‎image omitted
[6/12/19, 10:09:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol he was inconsistent as a starter. I want to go to that camp just to watch him get destroyed by AB and their 5th string receiver
[6/12/19, 10:16:26 PM] Joe Stine: He probably could have gotten drafted if he didnt do stupid shit off the field and get suspended every other season
[6/12/19, 10:16:52 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Probably. But he has always been retarded
[6/12/19, 10:17:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait is this like how Brett got on the dodgers where he got on the roster but he was just training pretty much
[6/12/19, 10:18:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And then now is in the minor leagues pretty sure
[6/12/19, 10:18:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He is probably deep in the depth chart
[6/12/19, 10:18:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: And the nfl allows a 20 person larger roster before the season. So cuts havent happened
[6/12/19, 10:18:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahhh
[6/12/19, 10:19:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I see
[6/12/19, 10:19:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So he’s probably gunna getcut let’s be honest
[6/12/19, 10:19:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He wasn’t starting at USC either if I remember right
[6/12/19, 10:20:22 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He was his senior year
[6/12/19, 10:20:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Inconsistent tho. I watched some of his games. He made big plays but also got fucked
[6/12/19, 10:20:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ahh
[6/12/19, 10:21:18 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think he only had one pick in his 4 years
[6/12/19, 10:23:40 PM] Joe Stine: He did his junior as well, he was supposed to start his sophomore year then got suspended for getting into a fight at a ucla frat party lol
[6/12/19, 10:23:48 PM] Joe Stine: So they benched him
[6/12/19, 10:24:05 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I remember that lol
[6/12/19, 10:24:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Damn
[6/12/19, 10:27:24 PM] Joe Stine: Same shit with kyle lmao he was the starter at wake forest. Then got kicked off the team for an "off the field incident"
[6/12/19, 10:27:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I forgot about him lol
[6/12/19, 11:23:36 PM] Chris Cheng: I literally watched him get fucked by Penn St.
[6/12/19, 11:23:42 PM] Chris Cheng: He cost us many touchdowns
[6/12/19, 11:23:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh yeah forgot chris watched those games lol
[6/12/19, 11:24:06 PM] Chris Cheng: 😑

[6/13/19, 8:30:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If ron artest can start the most infamous moment in nba history, and only get suspended a season, draymond will get a wrist slap
[6/13/19, 8:31:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True

[6/13/19, 8:38:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Can we get some younger refs that can actually see?
[6/13/19, 8:39:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: It’s rigged

[6/13/19, 8:40:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: Bro you know the warriors would have fouled the second raptors got the ball
[6/13/19, 8:40:19 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[6/13/19, 8:40:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: Why would they play defense and let time run out?
[6/13/19, 8:40:32 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because they were told the raptors will through it out
[6/13/19, 8:40:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I mean, it worked
[6/13/19, 8:40:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lollllll

[6/13/19, 8:42:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yo that’s actually back court
[6/13/19, 8:42:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Kawhi clearly touched it
[6/13/19, 8:42:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: On draymond
[6/13/19, 8:43:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: No they hit it out of his hand
[6/13/19, 8:43:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: And then draymond got it on the other side
[6/13/19, 8:44:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Oh i saw that
[6/13/19, 8:44:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But doesn’t him having possession mean it wouldn’t be backcourt?
[6/13/19, 8:44:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or am I just being dumb
[6/13/19, 8:44:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If he had possession in the backcourt

[6/13/19, 8:46:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It looked like kawhi pushed off iggy but iggy wrapped himself
[6/13/19, 8:46:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: But they wouldn’t be stopped if it was cuz who cares they don’t want to foul lmao

[6/20/19, 5:29:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or 9:10
[6/20/19, 5:41:46 PM] Owen Gilbert: 8:55, are they both just normal showings? Livermore?
[6/20/19, 5:43:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Normal showings
[6/20/19, 5:43:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Regal Pleasanton?
[6/20/19, 5:43:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or livermore. Whatchu guys want
[6/20/19, 5:46:59 PM] Jonathan Ong: Livermore better
[6/20/19, 5:54:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: We never said that lol
[6/20/19, 5:55:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah Livermore
[6/20/19, 5:55:13 PM] Cameron Freeman: And that’s Dublin lol
[6/20/19, 5:55:39 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Cameron wants to do Pasifica again for some reason
[6/20/19, 5:55:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Why so technical
[6/20/19, 5:56:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Well I mean if it ain’t broke don’t fix it? There was nothing wrong with Pacifica? We had hella space
[6/20/19, 5:56:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: And it’s closer to my place where we can go to after?
[6/20/19, 5:57:00 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahaha sorry
[6/20/19, 5:58:24 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: what's wrong with changing it up. We've been doing Pasifica for 2 years straight
[6/20/19, 5:58:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: Nothin wrong just like why? Haha
[6/20/19, 5:59:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: Thought it was our tradition 🥺
[6/20/19, 5:59:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What about a good compromise between panther and Pacifica? So we can drive back and do something new
[6/20/19, 5:59:33 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Well it's our tradition to spend 4th July together. Location is not part of the tradition
[6/20/19, 5:59:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Jon mentioned half moon bay
[6/20/19, 5:59:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m all for compromise it’s just what’s the difference between a beach closer and a beach farther? They are beaches
[6/20/19, 5:59:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Which isn’t bad
[6/20/19, 6:01:56 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The difference is a change of scenery. In SC you can explore the beaches other than the usual activities. Plus we can have campfires
[6/20/19, 6:02:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: Okay I see I’m down to find a place with campfire capability
[6/20/19, 6:03:15 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Campfire capability is God tier
[6/20/19, 6:03:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: It’s also just so dangerous driving on the roads in 4th of July especially since to get to SC it’s windy and dark dark
[6/20/19, 6:03:54 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's a fair point
[6/20/19, 6:05:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’d be down to bring s’mores stuff too if we do campfire. That’d be dope
[6/20/19, 6:05:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: I said windy but I meant wine-D idk how to spell it
[6/20/19, 6:06:09 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I'm down to look at other beaches in Half Moon Bay
[6/20/19, 6:07:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: You spelled it right
[6/20/19, 6:07:36 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: English is weird lmao
[6/20/19, 6:07:53 PM] Cameron Freeman: So how do u spell the one if there’s hella wind
[6/20/19, 6:08:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The same way I think
[6/20/19, 6:09:05 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The way the word is used depends on the context 😜
[6/20/19, 6:09:39 PM] Dev Naik: Y’all can still come to Portland ya know
[6/20/19, 6:10:17 PM] Dev Naik: It’s pretty here, no beach but the coast is a different kind of beauty
[6/20/19, 6:10:40 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's just a tiddy itty bitty out of the way
[6/20/19, 6:10:48 PM] Dev Naik: Just a little hah

[7/5/19, 8:34:22 PM] Dev Naik: Oh shit
[7/5/19, 8:34:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: East of LA west of Vegas like in the middle
[7/5/19, 8:34:38 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just now? They had a 6.8 yesterday
[7/5/19, 8:34:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah the 7.1 was earlier
[7/5/19, 8:34:59 PM] Dustin Bradley: And Disney had 4.8
[7/5/19, 8:35:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Chris and I were talking about it at like 3
[7/5/19, 8:35:07 PM] Dev Naik: Damn!!
[7/5/19, 8:35:20 PM] Dustin Bradley: Shit
[7/5/19, 8:35:25 PM] Jonathan Ong: 7.1 was just now
[7/5/19, 8:35:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That is nothing
[7/5/19, 8:35:30 PM] Jonathan Ong: Scary
[7/5/19, 8:35:47 PM] Dev Naik: 7.1 is no joke
[7/5/19, 8:35:58 PM] Dustin Bradley: No that’s not
[7/5/19, 8:36:05 PM] Dev Naik: That’s insane
[7/5/19, 8:36:06 PM] Cameron Freeman: But we would have def felt a 7.1
[7/5/19, 8:36:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No we wouldnt
[7/5/19, 8:36:19 PM] Jonathan Ong: Next big one is gonna hit Bay Area sooner or later
[7/5/19, 8:36:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: From SoCal? I don’t think so
[7/5/19, 8:36:32 PM] Jonathan Ong: It was in Vegas. Way too far
[7/5/19, 8:36:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Bish why would you speak that into existence
[7/5/19, 8:36:45 PM] Dustin Bradley: Not necessarily it dissipates at a certain point
[7/5/19, 8:36:50 PM] Chris Cheng: Yea wtf
[7/5/19, 8:36:55 PM] Jonathan Ong: Bc it’s true lol
[7/5/19, 8:37:02 PM] Jonathan Ong: It’s gonna happen
[7/5/19, 8:37:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Doesn’t matter. Just let it be. No purpose in assuming the worst. Prepare for it. But don’t assume it’ll happen
[7/5/19, 8:37:54 PM] Jonathan Ong: But it will happen. Just don’t know when
[7/5/19, 8:38:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Jon. You don’t get the point
[7/5/19, 8:38:26 PM] Jonathan Ong: Yeah I do
[7/5/19, 8:38:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If it’ll happen or not, what’s the purpose of speaking it into existence. It’s like when Dustin said “your car belt is gunna snap”
[7/5/19, 8:38:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Why speak it into existence. It’s a pessimistic ass way to think about it is what I’m saying.
[7/5/19, 8:39:00 PM] Dev Naik: Apparently it was a shallow depth which is worse
[7/5/19, 8:39:08 PM] Dev Naik: More damage
[7/5/19, 8:39:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[7/5/19, 8:39:14 PM] Dustin Bradley: Jon’s we don’t need none of your bad fujudojo shit Ight
[7/5/19, 8:39:16 PM] Dev Naik: And 40 seconds.... rough
[7/5/19, 8:39:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: Jon*
[7/5/19, 8:39:25 PM] Jonathan Ong: Bc I feel like it. I am assuming the worst bc we’re long overdue for a big one and we’re really close to major fault lines
[7/5/19, 8:42:36 PM] Jonathan Ong: Dustin saying that was a coincidence. If u do the research, seismologists agree that a big one will likely hit the Bay Area in the next few decades. Not being pessimistic, there’s just convincing evidence that a big one will come and is bound to happen sooner or later
[7/5/19, 8:43:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: It is going to happen. “Speaking it into existence” isnt going to happen because its said here. Its been said for years
[7/5/19, 8:44:02 PM] Dev Naik: Yes but no need for the bad juju
[7/5/19, 8:44:33 PM] Jonathan Ong: “Bad juju” lol
[7/5/19, 8:44:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Not bad juju, just be aware and plan. My family recently created and earthquake survival plan with a full kit
[7/5/19, 8:45:04 PM] Dev Naik: Of course you have to be prepared lol
[7/5/19, 8:45:33 PM] Dev Naik: I’m not saying and I don’t think anyone is saying don’t be prepared
[7/5/19, 8:46:54 PM] Dev Naik: I am probably the biggest advocate being prepared lol I’m an Eagle Scout, all I’m saying is having a more positive mindset about the situation is better to have
[7/5/19, 8:48:18 PM] Chris Cheng: Wat’s in an earthquake kit?
[7/5/19, 8:48:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh no chris
[7/5/19, 8:48:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Clothes, maglight, batteries, blankets etc
[7/5/19, 8:49:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Anything you need in an emergency situation
[7/5/19, 8:49:06 PM] Dev Naik: 10 essentials at the very least
[7/5/19, 8:49:25 PM] Dev Naik: More than that tho
[7/5/19, 8:49:28 PM] Chris Cheng: I see. Thank you!
[7/5/19, 8:49:37 PM] Dev Naik: Look up 10 essentials

[7/5/19, 8:51:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: 6.8 yesterday, 6.9 today
[7/5/19, 8:51:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Chris said Yvette felt it too
[7/5/19, 8:51:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Knicks pelicans felt it and the game is suspended
[7/5/19, 8:54:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Damnn

[7/5/19, 9:20:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: Fantastic lol
[7/5/19, 9:20:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t think ethan connected that either
[7/5/19, 9:20:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yep, that was why I was confused too
[7/5/19, 9:20:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because it was a few messages back cam.
[7/5/19, 9:20:52 PM] Cameron Freeman: San José state education

[7/5/19, 9:21:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Once I went back, not hard to say “I was responding to your message about espn”
[7/5/19, 9:21:42 PM] Dev Naik: I was not confused
[7/5/19, 9:21:43 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol sf state education requires not connecting things and just assuming everyone around you gets it
[7/5/19, 9:21:43 PM] Dustin Bradley: I mean you could of just said so to clarify instead of us trying to play games ya bigdumbbitch
[7/5/19, 9:21:44 PM] Cameron Freeman: Lol I know

[7/10/19, 11:59:39 AM] Dev Naik: 4Runners are nice
[7/10/19, 11:59:50 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Trucks are supposed to carry heavy load. They are supposed to be powerful
[7/10/19, 11:59:58 AM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s not what an electric truck can do lol
[7/10/19, 12:00:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Think utility of it
[7/10/19, 12:00:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: Wtf that looks like a trump supporters vehicle

[7/10/19, 12:01:32 PM] Dev Naik: Hella people who drive trucks don’t need one... so in this case I like having electric trucks, sure they may not be made for the heaviest duty of jobs but they can do the job that most people have trucks for

[7/10/19, 12:02:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If you buying a truck for the look, it’s kinda a stupid purchase
[7/10/19, 12:02:37 PM] Dev Naik: Tell that to so many people
[7/10/19, 12:02:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: When they go to the cabin, they need to bring the dock in or out. Bring the boat up.
[7/10/19, 12:02:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or bringing in furniture
[7/10/19, 12:02:53 PM] Dev Naik: Tell that to the people who drive trucks in the city by themselves
[7/10/19, 12:03:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I do and I will
[7/10/19, 12:03:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That shit stupid as fuck

[7/10/19, 12:03:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But can you take it off-road
[7/10/19, 12:03:52 PM] Dev Naik: Prob not bring a boat but the majority uses of a truck I think can be done in the Tesla
[7/10/19, 12:03:54 PM] Dev Naik: Probably
[7/10/19, 12:04:00 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes
[7/10/19, 12:04:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Look at the wheels

[7/10/19, 12:04:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The wheels aren’t the only thing you need to take something off-road
[7/10/19, 12:04:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lol
[7/10/19, 12:04:25 PM] Dev Naik: Hahahahahahaha my man said look at the wheels
[7/10/19, 12:04:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: Play me 1 on 1
[7/10/19, 12:04:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright. Agree to disagree but this car is for those who have no use for a truck but wanna drive around in something that is electric but also wanna feel like it has some sort of power
[7/10/19, 12:04:59 PM] Cameron Freeman: Me
[7/10/19, 12:05:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s gunna be the same motor as the model X and the model X can’t haul much I don’t think.
[7/10/19, 12:05:20 PM] Cameron Freeman: The definition of a weird flex but okay
[7/10/19, 12:05:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[7/10/19, 12:05:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Agree
[7/10/19, 12:05:37 PM] Cameron Freeman: Have you driven an x or s? That shit can hall anything
[7/10/19, 12:05:48 PM] Dev Naik: Yes, it will give some utility of a regular ass truck but won’t be able to do some crazy wild shit like tow a fat trailer
[7/10/19, 12:05:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: Even probably Gaby lemo
[7/10/19, 12:06:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: LOL

[7/10/19, 12:06:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: Don’t sleep on my boy Elon
[7/10/19, 12:06:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And I’ve driven the S not the X but ehh it won’t haul much. It’s not just “the wheels” to be able to haul stuff lol
[7/10/19, 12:06:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Maybe. I wanna say a little less than a regular ass truck
[7/10/19, 12:07:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’ll haul as much as a Toyota Tacoma. Which is the smaller end trucks
[7/10/19, 12:07:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Which is fine
[7/10/19, 12:07:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Good enough for a regular person
[7/10/19, 12:07:22 PM] Dev Naik: Might be fair to say
[7/10/19, 12:07:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But like... that shit not wet still lol
[7/10/19, 12:07:46 PM] Dev Naik: But also hella people who have massive trucks don’t need anything bigger than a Tacoma lol
[7/10/19, 12:08:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: I know.
[7/10/19, 12:08:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: How else are people supposed to compensate for having a small dick tho?
[7/10/19, 12:08:31 PM] Dev Naik: I can respect people who drive a Tacoma because that shit is reliable and will do so many things lol

[7/10/19, 12:20:48 PM] Dev Naik: The torque must be insane if you think about it

[7/11/19, 12:03:13 PM] Dustin Bradley: The game mode completely randomizes your load out eat round and the mode works around your style of play for instance if each team zones a flag will appear in the middle of the map you have to defend is for 3 seconds or so and if not the round will end with the winners having more health than the other team

[7/13/19, 2:53:48 AM] Joe Stine: I dont know if its worth contesting the case. Lmap
[7/13/19, 3:13:05 AM] Jonathan Ong: My take is that you’re smack right in the middle of the intersection so by law u did as what was required of u to do by continuing to drive through. But the question is did u hear or see the ambulance coming from the side before u started moving? If lights and/or siren was on and the ambulance was clearly in your line of sight before u started moving, then u may have a problem arguing your case. But if it isn’t and dash cam footage proves otherwise then u should shoot your shot and contest. If u told your parents, what do they say?
[7/13/19, 3:15:37 AM] Joe Stine: Heres the video keep in mind that my dash cam sits closer to the passenger side.
‎[7/13/19, 3:15:49 AM] Joe Stine: ‎video omitted
[7/13/19, 3:19:24 AM] Jonathan Ong: Damn
[7/13/19, 3:27:58 AM] Jonathan Ong: I think u could try to plead your case but not sure what the court would think after seeing that video. Bc I think saying that u “didn’t hear it” or “seeing it last second” would be something anyone would say in this situation. And it doesn’t help your case that the car next to u stopped as well as the cars on the other side of the street when the ambulance came, which shows that everyone else saw and heard it except u
[7/13/19, 3:32:04 AM] Jonathan Ong: But then again since u have the video, u could tell them u were already in the intersection before the ambulance came into your field of view and that u couldn’t  hear it until u were already moving in the intersection.. or something like that. I’m really unsure tbh
[7/13/19, 3:33:56 AM] Joe Stine: Yeah its a tough one lmao.
[7/13/19, 3:34:40 AM] Joe Stine: Thing is if the ambulance hit me they would be at fault 🤷🏼‍♂️

[7/18/19, 11:06:08 AM] Dustin Bradley: Guys I just heard on the news that the federal government was working on ticks as biological weapons and they would use them to spread either a disease or chemical which actually which makes sense because that’s what they already do but, they also said that these tests where during the start of 1990s and stoped in early 2000s and conducted in Missouri and another state that of which I cannot remember, however, even from way back when it’s still prevalent till this day that’s nuts 🥜 but also scary at the same time

[7/18/19, 1:00:59 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: From what I've read it looks luke it was a DD program from 1950-1975. Reports say that the DD weaponized Lyme Disease as an example to combat enemies of the State
[7/18/19, 1:01:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait, what is this “news” source
[7/18/19, 1:01:29 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I read that too
[7/18/19, 1:02:22 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I was going to ask that too becuase what I read was a little different
[7/18/19, 1:06:08 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Ok so the conspiracy theory is that the DD was experimenting with ticks and ended up creating Lyme disease
[7/18/19, 1:06:20 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Maybe that's why Dustin is so paranoid of ticks
[7/18/19, 1:06:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^^^^
[7/18/19, 1:08:11 PM] Dustin Bradley: I heard it on the news but from what I remember these dates that you sent Tim are a lot closer to what the news cast said than what I previously thought which was 1990s-2000s so my appologies I was way off but still that doesn’t disprove the fact that it is still relevant till this day
[7/18/19, 1:08:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s not necessarily relevant to this day tho?
[7/18/19, 1:08:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: How is it relevant
[7/18/19, 1:08:52 PM] Dustin Bradley: No I’m just paranoid of disease in general
[7/18/19, 1:10:31 PM] Dev Naik: There still are ticks
[7/18/19, 1:10:37 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Well the reason it's a conspiracy theory is that there is strong evidence that Lyme diseases predated us and existed during Columbus and even Egyptian times
[7/18/19, 1:11:18 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Lyme disease was derived from that bacterium that existed in the past through time.
[7/18/19, 1:11:25 PM] Dev Naik: And you can still get Lyme disease from them
[7/18/19, 1:11:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: This is true
[7/18/19, 1:12:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But the theory is that the DD did that
[7/18/19, 1:12:39 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Its apparently relevant becuase NJ, where the house rep who proposed the investigation, had a large number of recorded cases this year
[7/18/19, 1:13:02 PM] Dustin Bradley: Because the news was talking about, well if it is true, that the disease or so called biological weapons are still active even from way back in 1950s that’s a lot of time for a chemical or weapon of biotech to still be active just proves how devastating all out chemical warefare can be
[7/18/19, 1:13:34 PM] Dustin Bradley: Im sorry I’m not trying to be a downer I just thought it would be cool to discuss with you guys
[7/18/19, 1:13:50 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Nah were just joking about that lol
[7/18/19, 1:13:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: But its common knowledge that ticks carry lyme disease. That isnt the point of the investigation
[7/18/19, 1:14:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Its not about whether or not ticks carry these diseases, its about how they became carriers
[7/18/19, 1:15:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: At least that is how I read it
[7/18/19, 1:15:16 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: This
[7/18/19, 1:17:11 PM] Dustin Bradley: Ethan I agree with you it is common knowledge but what I’m thinking is what other chemical or disease besides Lyme disease did they try working on and what was the goal
[7/18/19, 1:17:23 PM] Dustin Bradley: If the experimentation
[7/18/19, 1:17:30 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Since this is a conspiracy theory I'm skeptical but I wouldent be surprised if the gov used ticks as a weapon. I also wont be surprised if they somehow fucked up and let a bunch of ticks loose
[7/18/19, 1:17:30 PM] Dustin Bradley: Of*
[7/18/19, 1:17:44 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: This would be the theory
[7/18/19, 1:17:56 PM] Dustin Bradley: True that’s almost impossible to control
[7/18/19, 1:18:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: If you are a sane human though, just realizing that ticks have been the carriers since Cleopatra kinda debunks everything
[7/18/19, 1:19:00 PM] Dustin Bradley: Because I feel like they spread like wild fire correct me if I’m wrong Dev
[7/18/19, 1:19:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Most insects do
[7/18/19, 1:19:38 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Could have been that ticks carried lyme but the disease was dormant and then scientists found a way to activate it. Idk
[7/18/19, 1:20:03 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Gotta love conspiracy theories
[7/18/19, 1:20:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im saying that there have been written documents about ticks causing spread of lyme disease long before the 20th century. At least I am pretty sure, can’t say that with 100% confidence
[7/18/19, 1:21:35 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's probably true but I bet the symptoms were different back then
[7/18/19, 1:22:07 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Which also doesnt make sense why the gov would weaponize lyme when it doesnt directly kill you
[7/18/19, 1:22:31 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I bet they created some super gnarly disease and then used lyme as a cover up for it
[7/18/19, 1:22:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wouldn’t it be kinda stupid since you would be in the hospital for a while aka wasting resources and such
[7/18/19, 1:23:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I guess it would be good for warfare
[7/18/19, 1:23:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But testing on your own people
[7/18/19, 1:23:51 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: We did have nazi scientists work for us during the cold war. That is a fact, not a conspiracy theoryb
[7/18/19, 1:24:06 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well ya anyone can say that but what about the diversity that comes with every organism. Not all insects act the same that’s why there’s differences amongst millions of species.
[7/18/19, 1:24:50 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: It would be stupid but yet I don't doubt it

[7/19/19, 8:09:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He doesn’t know
[7/19/19, 8:09:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nobody knows yet
[7/19/19, 8:09:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Interesting
[7/19/19, 8:09:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We trying to figure that out with the news
[7/19/19, 8:10:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He texted his mom about the motorcycle
[7/19/19, 8:16:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[7/19/19, 8:18:10 PM] Dev Naik: Damn
[7/19/19, 8:19:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He texted his mom about the motorcycle and she didn’t get anything after that when she asked if he was okay and then his dad saw the accident on the news. And then she got a call from John Muir.
[7/19/19, 8:19:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Scariest thing ever but man glad you are okay owen. Love ya man. Even though you don’t have your phone lol

[7/20/19, 2:44:03 PM] Owen Gilbert: Don't think I had my seatbelt on. I had started my car and was about to text my mom and probably got jolted to that side
[7/20/19, 2:44:19 PM] Owen Gilbert: I still dont remember the hit itself
[7/20/19, 2:45:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im just confused how you ended up in the lane and the suv ended up partly off the road
[7/20/19, 2:46:35 PM] Owen Gilbert: I guess my parents found out sort of that the suv swerved into the grass all the way up, then swerved back into the road. Hitting my back right
[7/20/19, 2:46:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Wtf
[7/20/19, 2:47:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats the only logical thing I can think of too
[7/20/19, 2:49:02 PM] Owen Gilbert: Also the tow place said based off of seeing all the cars they were worried about me the most, didnt think I lived
[7/20/19, 2:50:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh shit
[7/20/19, 2:50:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s wild
[7/20/19, 2:56:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yours was definitely the worst
[7/20/19, 2:56:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah most def
[7/20/19, 2:58:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I see. That’s what I was thinking or like you were in your passenger side putting away paperwork from the motorcycle thing
[7/20/19, 2:59:31 PM] Owen Gilbert: I was doing that but I was about to text my mom amd I remember hearing,g screeching and looking at the 2 cars out my left window and that's when it happened
[7/20/19, 3:00:20 PM] Owen Gilbert: So I think I was up on my side, not looking over or leaning on the passenger side
[7/20/19, 3:00:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I see
[7/20/19, 3:00:56 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Damn. That’s wild man

[7/22/19, 12:28:13 AM] Dustin Bradley: What?
[7/22/19, 12:28:28 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Way too soon
[7/22/19, 1:58:05 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Bro Frankenstein was the doctor
[7/22/19, 1:58:15 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Amateur move
[7/22/19, 1:58:17 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: That too
[7/22/19, 1:59:25 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Owen now if anybody asks 
1. You have a badads story
2. You can say you were mauled by a tiger
[7/22/19, 2:00:52 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: You're gonna get all the bitches
[7/22/19, 2:12:51 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Maybe i am just being oversensitive, since this is owen’s scenario...but this seems like a super inappropriate time to be joking about this. The dude has barely been able to be home, probably is dealing with a lot of pain still, and almost fucking died a couple days ago. Can we at least give him a week until we start playing with it?
[7/22/19, 2:15:24 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Like i still have nightmares of my first accident, and i hate it when people joke about it because I could have very easily not have been here
[7/22/19, 2:53:37 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I can see where you are coming from. If owen thinks its inappropriate then by all means I apologize and I'll shut up about it
[7/22/19, 2:57:00 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: The way I see it is that my comment, and dustins, was an attempt to make light of a bad situation. Different then joking about it. Call it, positive reinforcement. However, if Owen thinks it's bad taste then it's bad taste.
[7/22/19, 11:41:48 AM] Dustin Bradley: Ethan I hear you out man I understand the significance of the situation, however, I’m not in your guesses heads I don’t understand how you feel because I haven’t gone through what you and Owen have been through, so if I have over stepped my boundaries I apologize. I empathize with this situation all I ask is that you understand our stance, meaning the rest of us that having experienced life or death situation, like with what timmy said it was an attempt to make light out of a bad situation because we care and want positivity rather than depression
[7/22/19, 11:42:03 AM] Dustin Bradley: Haven’t*
[7/22/19, 11:45:31 AM] Dustin Bradley: Owen I apologize if I over stepped my ground I meant no ill intention
[7/22/19, 11:45:42 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: All I am saying is in the future, you guys need to be respectful of that fact that you don’t know what someone is going through. Don’t immediately jump into joking and trying to make light because the person going through it may not like that. Being empathic means catering to another based off their feelings, not how you would perceive a situation and want it to be handled
[7/22/19, 11:52:11 AM] Dustin Bradley: Ethan I’m sorry if I triggered you man but I want to hear from Owens words because this is his situation.
[7/22/19, 11:54:47 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: You are missing my point...
[7/22/19, 11:55:36 AM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s not just about Owen’s situation. We don’t need to hear from his perspective. Ethan’s just saying let’s be more mindful of others situations. We don’t wanna be like “hey owen, cool if I joke about it now” and go for it. He’s saying give it some time. Give him some space. To be able to heal and get his mind together before we go joking about.
[7/22/19, 11:56:36 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's exactly the point
[7/22/19, 11:56:40 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^. He shouldn’t have to give an okay for you to be able to joke. I am saying you should think before you say things
[7/22/19, 11:56:48 AM] Dustin Bradley: No I completely understand and this is why I hate texting
[7/22/19, 11:57:12 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Then why are you waiting for Owens response. The man’s just trying to rest. Let him rest.
[7/22/19, 11:57:28 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: You asked that I understand your stance and that you triggered me. That doesnt show understanding
[7/22/19, 11:58:33 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Just take the advice and move past, we don’t need to argue about this
[7/22/19, 11:59:47 AM] Dustin Bradley: Ok
[7/24/19, 7:10:47 PM] Joe Stine: Hey guys so I just received an off to continue working part time at Devonway. I plan on accepting the offer tomorrow as they will let me work remotely in Reno until the semester is over.
[7/24/19, 7:11:08 PM] Joe Stine: Offer*** 😄
[7/24/19, 7:11:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So go back to reno? Is that what you mean?

And basically if it wasnt clear enough, I'm completely innocent, and 2 people at fault, the initial driver that started it, and the suv driver that hit me, first driver for driving at unsafe speeds for the current traffic, and the suv driver for unsafly swerving, apparently the law says that if you are swerving to avoid something, its unsafe as welI, really only if you hit something

[8/18/19, 9:51:34 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Its becuase they're a domestic terrorist organization
[8/18/19, 9:52:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So are the proud boys
[8/18/19, 9:52:06 PM] Dev Naik: Antifa technically isn’t an organization
[8/18/19, 9:52:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They are both extremists

[8/18/19, 9:53:31 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's that antifa means but that's not what they stand for. Ya everybody is anti facist, unless you're a facist
[8/18/19, 9:54:14 PM] Jonathan Ong: That’s ironic bc the way they behave, think, and act is exactly how actual fascists would
[8/18/19, 9:54:31 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: RT
[8/18/19, 9:54:34 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I dont think you know what that means
[8/18/19, 9:55:06 PM] Dev Naik: 😂
[8/18/19, 9:56:04 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Unless i am mistaken, antifa is self governed. Fascism requires a leader does it not?
[8/18/19, 9:56:12 PM] Dev Naik: Facts
[8/18/19, 9:56:21 PM] Dev Naik: A dictator like figure
[8/18/19, 9:57:03 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I am opposed to violence and extremism on both sides, but be factual about your opions
[8/18/19, 9:57:07 PM] Jonathan Ong: They mask themselves, vandalize, riot, and physically assault ppl who they don’t like or disagree with. That’s literally how the blackshirts were in Italy during Mussolini’s reign
[8/18/19, 9:57:07 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Opinion*
[8/18/19, 9:57:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats just radicalism, not fascism. Fascism is a style of government
[8/18/19, 9:57:47 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You literally could describe any radical organization that way
[8/18/19, 9:57:49 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Facism is a type of ideology

[8/18/19, 9:58:59 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: This is getting away from the point. The point is antifa is bad

[8/18/19, 10:02:06 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I agree. I think hitting people with bike locks over their heads is not the way to prove a point

[8/18/19, 10:03:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Not sure how what i said means shutting you out
[8/18/19, 10:04:00 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's fair

[8/18/19, 10:05:39 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Maybe I'm biased becuase I've seen a lot of fucked up shit antifa has done, but not anything proud boys have done
[8/18/19, 10:06:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Didnt the proud boys sponsor the charleston march
[8/18/19, 10:07:05 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Oh ya shit gavin mcinnes, the founder of Vice, founded proud boys
[8/18/19, 10:07:07 PM] Dev Naik: I would be 100% comfortable being alone with someone from antifa but you best believe you will NEVER catch me alone with any proud boy or white supremacist
[8/18/19, 10:07:35 PM] Dev Naik: Might be true for the violence aspect
[8/18/19, 10:08:49 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: No that was sponsored by Jason Kessler and richard Spencer
[8/18/19, 10:09:11 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: “Sponsor” being a loose term

[8/18/19, 10:09:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But what’s a proud boy

[8/18/19, 10:16:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I can grab a thick log and use it in the same way. A piece of metal.
[8/18/19, 10:16:23 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Anything
[8/18/19, 10:16:30 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s the fact of using it
[8/18/19, 10:16:31 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeee
[8/18/19, 10:16:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: All good. I should’ve reworded it
[8/18/19, 10:17:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But using it for the specific purpose of lynching tho. That’s especially fucked
[8/18/19, 10:17:44 PM] Dev Naik: So proud boys are apparently going to be coming back every month to Portland until the Mayer kicks out all of antics from the city??
[8/18/19, 10:17:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because bike locks especially the wire ones man. Like damn..
[8/18/19, 10:18:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Can we go kick em out ourselves
[8/18/19, 10:18:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Gg portland
[8/18/19, 10:18:20 PM] Dev Naik: Let’s kick out all of the violence

[8/18/19, 10:18:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like god damn how much effort does it take the mayor to say hey nah. We good homie. Get out
[8/18/19, 10:18:51 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He would have to make a stance on both or get retaliation
[8/18/19, 10:19:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: How so?
[8/18/19, 10:19:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Can you explain? I’m kinda lost
[8/18/19, 10:19:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: What you mean
[8/18/19, 10:19:16 PM] Dev Naik: Well at some point you also have to say to the proud boys to not bring your guns and shit and maybe we can all sit down and have a grown up conversation
[8/18/19, 10:19:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I don’t think you can have a grown up conversation with someone called the proud boys
[8/18/19, 10:19:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They are radicalist groups. Antifa “bases” themselves there. Proud boys are there until antifa disbands apparently
[8/18/19, 10:19:56 PM] Dev Naik: Lol
[8/18/19, 10:20:04 PM] Dev Naik: It’s not gonna happen
[8/18/19, 10:20:21 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Right. So the mayor cant pick sides
[8/18/19, 10:20:28 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly
[8/18/19, 10:20:36 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats career suicide to side with either
[8/18/19, 10:20:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait. So what are the 2 sides?
[8/18/19, 10:20:46 PM] Jonathan Ong: U could literally say that about Antifa too with how they assault ppl riot and vandalize. It goes both ways
[8/18/19, 10:20:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: OHHHH
[8/18/19, 10:20:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Wait I got it
[8/18/19, 10:21:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: He has to pick antiFa or proud boys
[8/18/19, 10:21:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oh damn
[8/18/19, 10:21:13 PM] Dev Naik: The only thing to do is to unite the city to get rid of all violence
[8/18/19, 10:21:14 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes
[8/18/19, 10:21:20 PM] Jonathan Ong: Kick em both out or leave it

[8/18/19, 10:21:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah why not take a stance on violence alone and kick them both out equally
[8/18/19, 10:21:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats a lot of voters
[8/18/19, 10:22:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fuck em voters
[8/18/19, 10:22:03 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly because violence is the real issue

[8/18/19, 10:50:46 PM] Dev Naik: Mohit is the brown klansman

‎[8/19/19, 12:13:45 AM] Owen Gilbert: ‎video omitted
[8/19/19, 12:14:49 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I wanna have that level of clout
[8/19/19, 12:57:23 PM] Jonathan Ong: For any of y’all that care, I found a well written article on antifa. It isn’t too heavily one sided like most of the others that I found online, and The Atlantic is a pretty reputable source that’s usually left of center on the spectrum
[8/19/19, 12:57:25 PM] Jonathan Ong: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-violent-left/534192/
[8/19/19, 12:57:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Do not share the atlantic
[8/19/19, 12:57:59 PM] Jonathan Ong: Jesus just read it
[8/19/19, 12:58:23 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: No one argued against antifa, i thought we already agreed
[8/19/19, 12:58:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Being violent*
[8/19/19, 1:01:51 PM] Jonathan Ong: I’m was going to argue against it but did not seem worth it at the time.. I’m trying to say that u can’t separate the violence from their ideology because it’s very much a part of their values
[8/19/19, 1:02:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes, agreed. Antifa is very much fight fire with fire. I understand why they would want to, but it helps nothing
[8/19/19, 1:07:32 PM] Jonathan Ong: Aight glad we agree on that.. also in the cases of Portland and Berkeley a few years, all I’ve seen from reading online and in countless videos is that 9 times out of 10, antifa is always the one inciting the violence against the other side. Literally assaulting ppl who are just peacefully standing there for wearing clothing that’s pro-trump or pro American.. bottom line is that I’m just bothered by what @19256993454 said  yesterday that despite their actions, he still supports their values somehow
[8/19/19, 1:08:08 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think he means what i said. Its a valid stance, incorrect response
[8/19/19, 1:20:13 PM] Jonathan Ong: Idk man based on all of his comments, he denounces the violence yes, but not once did he denounce the group itself.. and u can’t separate their actions from their ideology, u just can’t.. it’s analogous to saying “I support hitler’s values and beliefs, but I denounce the genocide of millions of Jews, poles, and Slavs” as if his actions are somehow not bred from or have no relation to his ideology
[8/19/19, 1:20:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I think you are thinking too much into it
[8/19/19, 1:21:02 PM] Jonathan Ong: It just bothers me bc I’ve seen too much of what that group has done
[8/19/19, 1:21:06 PM] Dev Naik: The violent individuals from antifa are primarily anarchists rather that people who are anti fascism. Time and tine again it happens in Portland. The riots that happened when trump was elected in Portland were all protests at first until masked anarchists came and were violent
[8/19/19, 1:21:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You also support Trump, so it seems hypocritical that you are calling out Dev for essentially the same thing
[8/19/19, 1:22:07 PM] Dev Naik: I do not condone any violence from anyone, I agree with values of anti fascism and anti racism
[8/19/19, 1:22:48 PM] Dev Naik: ^
[8/19/19, 1:26:07 PM] Jonathan Ong: I’m really not tbh. It’s just logic
[8/19/19, 1:26:45 PM] Jonathan Ong: Violence is their ideology
[8/19/19, 1:26:54 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I mean about dev’s thoughts
[8/19/19, 1:27:05 PM] Dev Naik: What you also aren’t talking about is the violence from the other side. All of the hate crimes and targeted violence against people of color and minorities. Like I said already I do not condone any violence from either party but I agree with the anti racism and anti fascism
[8/19/19, 1:28:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: Facts
[8/19/19, 1:28:46 PM] Dev Naik: And antifa has values of anti racism and anti racism therefore I agree with that basis of the ideology but not the violence..
[8/19/19, 1:29:04 PM] Dev Naik: This is exactly what I mean
[8/19/19, 1:29:25 PM] Jonathan Ong: He has never lended any support to alt right or white nationalist groups
[8/19/19, 1:29:58 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: He literally has supported KKK backed groups. It is very open information
[8/19/19, 1:30:25 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I dont have the time or energy to argue today about politics, i just jumped in because your attack on dev wasnt warranted
[8/19/19, 1:30:34 PM] Dev Naik: Yeah I’m confused lol...
[8/19/19, 1:30:46 PM] Dev Naik: It’s out there and known
[8/19/19, 1:31:00 PM] Dev Naik: Thank you
[8/19/19, 1:32:49 PM] Cameron Freeman: ❤
[8/19/19, 1:33:10 PM] Dev Naik: All love ❤
[8/19/19, 1:34:05 PM] Jonathan Ong: From all the videos that I’ve seen in Berkeley and Portland, the antifa protestors were always the one to incite violence, not the protestors on the right, who were peaceful
[8/19/19, 1:34:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But you can’t generalize that from what you’ve seen online
[8/19/19, 1:34:45 PM] Jonathan Ong: Why do u consider this an attack, I just don’t agree with him that’s all
[8/19/19, 1:35:01 PM] Dev Naik: And when have I ever said I condone that violence. I don’t agree with any violence
[8/19/19, 1:35:17 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes, but its like how evangelical “christians” come onto college campuses spewing nonsense about “christianity” hating everyone so that they can incite a response
[8/19/19, 1:35:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yes of course there are people who cause issues but that’s doesn’t mean we can blanket a statement that ALLL AntiFa cause issues. Or that all right wings aren’t doing anything
[8/19/19, 1:36:02 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You were bothered by them and so called him out. Thats what I consider attacking. Im just saying I dont think you understand him correctly
[8/19/19, 1:36:58 PM] Dev Naik: Yups
[8/19/19, 1:37:24 PM] Jonathan Ong: But I’m willing to bet that if u stand next to antifa in pro trump or pro America gear, they will openly assault u for no reason. At least the protestors on the right are willing to have conversations with u even you disagree with them and sporting anti America and anti trump clothing and propaganda
[8/19/19, 1:37:40 PM] Dev Naik: This too
[8/19/19, 1:37:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That is 100% not true
[8/19/19, 1:37:53 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Antifa doesnt just openly beat people up
[8/19/19, 1:38:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s like saying, Jon, you are a trump supporter. I hate you as a person. No I separate you actions and your ideologies separate. Because your ideology doesn’t necessarily mean you will grab a girl by the pussy.
[8/19/19, 1:38:24 PM] Jonathan Ong: But they don’t go beating the shit out of ppl for not agreeing with them
[8/19/19, 1:38:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You arent understanding
[8/19/19, 1:38:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You are making blanket statements Jon. You are making an assumption that they will always do it 100% of the time.
[8/19/19, 1:38:56 PM] Joe Stine: 🤔 who could this be
[8/19/19, 1:39:13 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lolll
[8/19/19, 1:39:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Looooool
[8/19/19, 1:40:07 PM] Jonathan Ong: No I’m just looking at the big picture
[8/19/19, 1:40:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But Jon, maybe your argument would work if it wasn’t a blanket statement. But maybe you’re right. Maybe it does happen often. But, you can’t assume that the right is all so perfect and the antiFa are demons. Every side has a shitty side to it.
[8/19/19, 1:40:45 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Jon, if I stood in front of you roasting the shit out of you with hatred and spitting and pointing at you, then you punch me. Am I not to blame?
[8/19/19, 1:41:07 PM] Dev Naik: This is what happens
[8/19/19, 1:41:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I never touched you, but that doesnt mean I am innocent and only you should be at fault
[8/19/19, 1:41:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[8/19/19, 1:41:28 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because verbal abuse is almost as bad as physical abuse
[8/19/19, 1:41:36 PM] Dev Naik: ^^^^^^^^^^
[8/19/19, 1:41:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Mental/verbal*
[8/19/19, 1:42:57 PM] Jonathan Ong: I totally get that and I’m not defending everything the right does, I’m just arguing against antifa bc I believe that the vast majority of them do buy into their violent ideologies and act on it, but that’s where we disagree and that’s fine
[8/19/19, 1:43:57 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes. A majority. But the movement was not based to just riot and be violent. It was brought to the extreme. All we have said is that we are anti fascism and anti racism, which at its core, its antifa’s values
[8/19/19, 1:44:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True.
[8/19/19, 1:45:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The same way we look at the right’s ideology being separate from the verbal and physical abuse, we separate the violence from antiFa from their ideology
[8/19/19, 1:46:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Thank you for explaining your side by the way
[8/19/19, 1:46:24 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly. There are always going to be extremists on every side who take it too far
[8/19/19, 1:47:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: The “right” literally are responsible for the mass shootings from a week or two ago. 25 dead in total i believe. But we arent saying that is the fault of a certain group, they are extremists backed by an ideology.
[8/19/19, 1:47:55 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That ideology is not to blame, the extremists are
[8/19/19, 1:48:01 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ^^^^
[8/19/19, 1:48:09 PM] Dev Naik: Facts
[8/19/19, 1:49:13 PM] Jonathan Ong: Freedom of speech. They have the right say whatever they want no matter how extreme or crazy without being punched in the face
[8/19/19, 1:49:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That actually is not true
[8/19/19, 1:49:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Hence why hate speech is against the law
[8/19/19, 1:49:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That's not true, what if their speech is inciting a riot? or it is hate speech?
[8/19/19, 1:50:01 PM] Jonathan Ong: They do, quite often
[8/19/19, 1:50:28 PM] Dev Naik: Hate speech is targeting and attacking someone or a group of people
[8/19/19, 1:50:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Jon, you are picking and choosing your fights here. No one walks around the street and just beats people up. Thats not how the world works
[8/19/19, 1:51:01 PM] Jonathan Ong: KKK and far right neo nazis are bad news just like antifa
[8/19/19, 1:51:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: Actually you can argue the ideology of Mexicans being rapists and criminals and immigrants being criminals and bad  could be to blame for the shooting in El Paso (because that’s what the shooter said) and you can blame the ideology of jons president for speaking these exact words of the shooter to his nation
[8/19/19, 1:51:24 PM] Jonathan Ong: Nah it’s just takes forever for me to respond because so much is being said
[8/19/19, 1:52:20 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Yes, but those are extreme versions of the simple ideologies of wanting more secure borders and better vetting processes
[8/19/19, 1:52:35 PM] Joe Stine: Just nuke every1 lmao.
[8/19/19, 1:52:50 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah but you can still separate their ideologies and actions and see that BOTH things are horrible and they are bad people. There's a difference. The point is to be able to separate those 2 and still be able to come up with a rational decision
[8/19/19, 1:52:56 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Honestly I was gonna go play on the freeway, seems faster
[8/19/19, 1:53:15 PM] Dev Naik: And more sustainable
[8/19/19, 1:53:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Here we go
[8/19/19, 1:53:34 PM] Dev Naik: Heheheh
[8/19/19, 1:53:38 PM] Joe Stine: Had to find a way to bring in the enviromment. Hippie.
[8/19/19, 1:53:49 PM] Dustin Bradley: 100% agree because I feel that most of the time violence over shadows or is more focused upon than verbal abuse. The act of physically hurting someone I believe in today’s society is more significant to the public’s eye because it is an action,  which is more impactful when others witness it but every action comes and manifest through thought so verbal is definitely just as bad as physical or could be worse.
[8/19/19, 1:53:54 PM] Dev Naik: Peace and love man
[8/19/19, 1:54:06 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I thought you were jon because both of you have the same color for me, so I was about to just delete whatsapp
[8/19/19, 1:54:27 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahahahaha
[8/19/19, 1:54:28 PM] Dev Naik: LOl
[8/19/19, 1:54:32 PM] Dev Naik: LOL*
[8/19/19, 1:54:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: ahhahahhahahaah
[8/19/19, 1:54:54 PM] Jonathan Ong: I’m arguing the the majority of antifa are extremists, and they do openly go out and attack ppl. That’s not how the world works but that’s how antifa works
[8/19/19, 1:55:04 PM] Joe Stine: What color am I pink?
[8/19/19, 1:55:10 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: So do neo nazis, whats your point
[8/19/19, 1:55:17 PM] Mohit Veligenti: you are blue and jon is pink
[8/19/19, 1:55:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: for me
[8/19/19, 1:55:28 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Dark blue, jon is a lightish purple for me
[8/19/19, 1:55:37 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Darkish*
[8/19/19, 1:55:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: what ethan said, i am colorblind
[8/19/19, 1:55:43 PM] Joe Stine: Racist
[8/19/19, 1:55:58 PM] Dustin Bradley: Wait no I’m pink
[8/19/19, 1:56:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: wow just wow. i dont like this amount of seggregation
[8/19/19, 1:56:16 PM] Jonathan Ong: U said earlier that “no one walks around the street and just beats people up. Thats not how the world works”
[8/19/19, 1:56:31 PM] Cameron Freeman: Jons pink for mee too!
[8/19/19, 1:56:56 PM] Dev Naik: Antifa doesn’t just go out and shoot a bunch of white supremacist. But time and time again we see the other side targeting minorities with violence and discrimination
[8/19/19, 1:56:59 PM] Dustin Bradley: The fuck I used to be green now devs green
[8/19/19, 1:57:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Neither of them will just start attacking on the street, there will be some buildup. But the same way antifa acts out is very similar to hate groups
[8/19/19, 1:57:14 PM] Dustin Bradley: *light green
[8/19/19, 1:57:15 PM] Dev Naik: Because I’m the environmentalists
[8/19/19, 1:58:04 PM] Dev Naik: Agreed
[8/19/19, 1:58:06 PM] Dustin Bradley: That’s bullshit I’m an alien so I should be green WhatsApp is racist
[8/19/19, 1:58:16 PM] Cameron Freeman: Neo nazis confirmed have just started attacking on the streets.
[8/19/19, 1:58:19 PM] Jonathan Ong: Im just saying I’ve seen antifa do it countless times to people who are just standing there
[8/19/19, 1:58:35 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You have watched it happen in real life? Videos dont tell the whole story
[8/19/19, 1:58:58 PM] Jonathan Ong: Some do
[8/19/19, 1:59:00 PM] Dev Naik: I’ve seen this shit in real like it’s not just someone beating someone up
[8/19/19, 1:59:08 PM] Dev Naik: Life*
[8/19/19, 1:59:49 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: That is not how that works lol. No one is just randomly filming the start of an interaction unless it is planned. And if it is planned then your argument doesnt make sense because it wouldnt be random
[8/19/19, 2:00:01 PM] Dev Naik: There is a constant harassment from one side to lead to the other acting violently.
[8/19/19, 2:01:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: Where as, when I was at the Beverly hill museum of tollearance. They had these two guys telling a story of how a gay guy was walking on the street with his mans, and these three skin heads came up and started beating them just because they were gay. At the end of the presentation, one of the guys was the guy who got beat up and the other guy was one of the skin heads who beat him up. And he spoke saying they literally did nothing but exists and be gay and they wanted to kill them for that
[8/19/19, 2:01:25 PM] Dev Naik: But what is random is the shootings and the hate against minorities from the “right”
[8/19/19, 2:01:29 PM] Dev Naik: Exactly
[8/19/19, 2:01:34 PM] Jonathan Ong: That’s not true.. randomly filming of these incidents happens quite often
[8/19/19, 2:01:48 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: I would love to see one
[8/19/19, 2:04:08 PM] Jonathan Ong: Honestly most ppl don’t care about your race, gender, sexual preference or whatever. The media just likes to screw with your head, twist politicians’ words, and say that a majority of conservatives hate people of color, lgbt, and all that which is far from the truth
[8/19/19, 2:04:21 PM] Dev Naik: In the case of the proud boys, they came to Portland to provoke antifa to cause the extremists to be violent so they would be able to put the blame on them rather then showcasing the taunting and verbal abuse
[8/19/19, 2:04:53 PM] Dev Naik: That’s just not true.
[8/19/19, 2:05:27 PM] Jonathan Ong: They have freedom of speech just like antifa, but violence is bad coming from either side. I’ve just seen it happening more from antifa
[8/19/19, 2:05:30 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Agreed, the media loves brandishing a lot of “facts” about one side or the other. But you are insane if you refuse to believe these attacks arent based on hate
[8/19/19, 2:05:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Let’s say every antifa randomly beat up the racists on the street. Let’s pretend. A racist beating someone up just for being their skin color or having a “different” sexual orientation opposed to someone fighting someone who has beliefs that are racist and hateful. I can say from me I’m okay with that. Violence is never the answer, but sometimes, like we were taught when we were young, sometimes, you have to hit back and not let someone walk all over you. And if someone is attacking someone on the streets, I wouldn’t lose any sleep knowing it was someone who thinks about doing that to me 🤷🏾‍♂
[8/19/19, 2:05:42 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Then you need to look at more information
[8/19/19, 2:06:16 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Im out yall. My energy is kapoot
[8/19/19, 2:06:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: To sum this up, idk how you can feel bad for a group of people getting beat up that holds those hateful and disgusting views on inoccent people.
[8/19/19, 2:08:23 PM] Dev Naik: For me violence doesn’t solve anything. I don’t agree with the views at all but I also don’t agree with violence
[8/19/19, 2:08:36 PM] Dev Naik: No need to stoop on the same level
[8/19/19, 2:08:58 PM] Jonathan Ong: The attacks are definitely based on hate and severe mental issues. I was referring to the media brainwashing about the hate from coming from a majority of conservatives. But that’s been happening for years
[8/19/19, 2:09:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: You could say the same thing about fox news brainwashing us about liberals?
[8/19/19, 2:10:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Same but i'm just tired of training right now lol
[8/19/19, 2:10:28 PM] Cameron Freeman: The media says this based on actual quotes and evidence of the hate. No media makes these words up. The media is a scape goat and thing to blame when these people say things that they could say before and get away with but now can’t. Literally go on ur presidents twitter and you will see all of the color, lgbt, gender and racial hate
[8/19/19, 2:11:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: No I completely feel you and agree im basically saying if hitler was being beat up for what he did would u really feel bad for him? Hahaha that’s just me
[8/19/19, 2:13:36 PM] Dustin Bradley: This whole conversation sums up the problems with our world today in politics and in everyday life. Humans can’t seem to find common ground because we are all stuck up in our own ways and beliefs. I just don’t understand why these difference beliefs cannot coexist, wait I know why, became people are so damn prideful that they just don’t want to admit their wrong.
[8/19/19, 2:13:39 PM] Jonathan Ong: I don’t feel bad, but they have a right to say whatever they want no matter how crazy or extreme, as long as your not making threats against the actual person, property, or whatever. That’s the glory of America, freedom of speech. Once u start chipping away from that and begin deciding what someone can or cannot say, u start breaking down a core foundation of what this country was built upon
[8/19/19, 2:14:53 PM] Joe Stine: Wrong
[8/19/19, 2:15:03 PM] Joe Stine: Baiting btw.
[8/19/19, 2:15:10 PM] Jonathan Ong: People are just such pussies nowadays that saying certain words or statements that ppl don’t agree with equates a response of physical violence, which we see from both sides
[8/19/19, 2:15:41 PM] Dev Naik: More so when it’s an attack on someone
[8/19/19, 2:16:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: 1st. The country was built upon slavery and hate from the beggening so to hell with this countries foundation. They do not have a right to say whatever they want no matter how crazy or extreme because these things can cause riot and hateful actions like all of your homies mass shootings but you know this, we are going in circles, this has already been said so I guess u will just believe what you believe
[8/19/19, 2:16:03 PM] Dev Naik: When you are targeting someone or a group of individuals in a negative way it’s hate speech
[8/19/19, 2:16:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: man i just wanna drink a beer and play some basketball is that so hard to ask
[8/19/19, 2:16:53 PM] Dustin Bradley: Hahahahaha
[8/19/19, 2:17:16 PM] Dev Naik: That too, this counties past is not something we should be proud of. We need to change as times do.
[8/19/19, 2:18:08 PM] Jonathan Ong: Someone can call me a dirty fucking chink who should go back to China and eat dogs in the rice field, but that does not give me the right to beat the shit outta him. Ppl need to learn to brush that shit off and let go bc those who make those sort of comments are not worth the fight and are sub par human beings to begin with
[8/19/19, 2:18:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I know what to say next time I see you.
[8/19/19, 2:18:45 PM] Joe Stine: Bet.
[8/19/19, 2:18:53 PM] Jonathan Ong: 😢
[8/19/19, 2:18:54 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exaclty! This may seem super “radical” but I think we need a whole ass new constitution. I don’t know why we are sticking so hard and need to keep something made SOOO long ago by people who would not understand this world we live in now
[8/19/19, 2:19:49 PM] Dev Naik: I don’t disagree with you, I too believe we need take the more mature path and not let people get the better of us, but you can’t just let people running around taunting people. It’s just not going to end wel regardless
[8/19/19, 2:20:05 PM] Dev Naik: And it’s all about context as well
[8/19/19, 2:21:03 PM] Dev Naik: I think there are things we can 100% learn from our past however and from the constitution
[8/19/19, 2:21:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: You don’t get it. It’s language like this group of people are criminals this group of people must be stopped this group of people are here to hurt us. When u are constantly told that when u encounter these people you want to do what you can to “stop them” or “protect your county” the language language used demonizes a group and makes it okay to be violent and hateful to them.
[8/19/19, 2:22:06 PM] Jonathan Ong: We are the greatest civilazation that humans have ever seen, nothing is stopping u or me from being successful and achieving happiness. We are free, economically prosperous, and strong. U can’t say that about many other places in the world
[8/19/19, 2:22:30 PM] Dev Naik: The only way to stop it is to end it at the source and the source is the taunting and the hate speech
[8/19/19, 2:22:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ooo. Uhhh. I don’t know about this
[8/19/19, 2:22:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: There’s a lot of things stopping me from being successful
[8/19/19, 2:23:04 PM] Dev Naik: With the exception of people of minorities are less privileged than a white male
[8/19/19, 2:23:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: You can’t say we are economically prosperous and strong lol and we can say that about many places in the world. Many places in the world have it a lot better than us Jon. I know that’s hard to believe because your president tells you that we are the best but it’s not true
[8/19/19, 2:23:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: The US is the laughing stock of the world
[8/19/19, 2:23:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We are free to a limitation and we have rich families and high status people who literally stop us from being successful and control shit that we have nothing to do with.
[8/19/19, 2:24:16 PM] Dev Naik: Facts
[8/19/19, 2:24:21 PM] Dev Naik: Facts
[8/19/19, 2:24:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: The Koch brothers as an example. They literally slow down public transportation, electric car growth, solar energy, so on.
[8/19/19, 2:24:35 PM] Jonathan Ong: Does not make them ok to be violent. But they can say whatever they want. Hate speech is protected as long as u don’t physically threaten or hurt others. There will always be ppl who think and talk like this no matter where u are in the world, that will never change
[8/19/19, 2:25:54 PM] Dev Naik: Agree but if we stop the hate speech, that’s easier to stop then physical violence
[8/19/19, 2:25:56 PM] Cameron Freeman: No it doesn’t make it okay but that’s what has been happening Jon. And that is what will continue to happen when people continue to use this language. Hate speech is not protected. I thought you memorized the constitution. That is not what it says.
[8/19/19, 2:26:12 PM] Jonathan Ong: Not realistic
[8/19/19, 2:26:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah nah I agree with Jon this isn’t possible
[8/19/19, 2:26:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: People gunna be fools.
[8/19/19, 2:26:41 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Can’t stop dumbasses from being dumbasses
[8/19/19, 2:26:59 PM] Dev Naik: Of course it’s not possible but it’s more possible than to stop the reaction of violence
[8/19/19, 2:27:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Not true. For example. When Obama was President compared to when Trump is statistically the amount of hate and violence has gone up exponentially! Why? Because of the rederic and language used by both of them
[8/19/19, 2:27:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I can see it but at the same time decrease isn’t the same as extinction?
[8/19/19, 2:27:52 PM] Dev Naik: Ya but decrease is better than what it is now
[8/19/19, 2:27:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: But it’s going the right direction and way
[8/19/19, 2:27:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Of course
[8/19/19, 2:28:08 PM] Dev Naik: And to minimize to the best of our ability is what’s best
[8/19/19, 2:28:11 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But you’re talking about extinction
[8/19/19, 2:28:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Not decreasing
[8/19/19, 2:28:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Decreasing is good and everyone is for it
[8/19/19, 2:28:27 PM] Dev Naik: Because I agree it’s impossible to stop it entirely
[8/19/19, 2:28:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Okay okay we on the same page
[8/19/19, 2:28:42 PM] Dev Naik: Yee
[8/19/19, 2:29:13 PM] Jonathan Ong: Yes it’s called competition. Life’s unfair and we don’t always get what we want. Sometimes big corporations cut corners, cheat, take shortcuts, but that’s the reality in this free market. But nothing is personally stopping u, mohit, from doing your business in com sci and making a successful living, or stopping Cameron from his achieving his goals in media, or stopping me from becoming a doctor
[8/19/19, 2:30:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah but there’s a difference between competition and cheating. Competition means you and me have the same opportunity to get a job at Workday. Cheating means I hack the system to send my resume in. The second is unethical and wrong and 1st isn’t.
[8/19/19, 2:30:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And who has more resources to cheat
[8/19/19, 2:30:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So yes there are limitations
[8/19/19, 2:31:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s reality but doesn’t mean it’s ethical
[8/19/19, 2:31:14 PM] Cameron Freeman: What about someone who couldn’t afford college or who had so many medical bills they couldn’t go to college and now what they want to do they can’t do it because they need a degree but they also got fucking rapped and need to take care or their kids. Yes we are lucky but not everyone is as lucky as us
[8/19/19, 2:31:21 PM] Dev Naik: This just isn’t true, you are looking at us who are all privileged
[8/19/19, 2:31:27 PM] Mohit Veligenti: True
[8/19/19, 2:31:48 PM] Cameron Freeman: It’s called equity. How un even people start. Not everyone can “start from the bottom and be here” - Drake
[8/19/19, 2:32:11 PM] Cameron Freeman: Exactly
[8/19/19, 2:32:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Equality vs equity true
[8/19/19, 2:34:53 PM] Jonathan Ong: U said earlier that the rich stopping u from being successful which I don’t believe is true in the slightest. U have more of a shot to become a millionaire in this country  than anywhere else as long as u play your cards right, work smart and hard
[8/19/19, 2:37:18 PM] Jonathan Ong: Dude my family is full of immigrants who came here with nothing in their pockets. All they had was their wit, grit, and determination to get where they are today. Now they’re doctors, engineers, working in management. I bet many of u had family members who did the same since we’re so ethnically diverse. Anyone can do it
[8/19/19, 2:42:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Whhhhh I wanna argue my point but I’m doing real shit in boot camp now so I’ll argue this later
[8/19/19, 2:42:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But I don’t think you are thinking about it holistically
[8/19/19, 2:42:39 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And the present time.
[8/19/19, 2:42:49 PM] Mohit Veligenti: There’s a difference between our family doing it and doing it now
[8/19/19, 2:43:14 PM] Jonathan Ong: I agree the system does have its flaws but the results of many people’s lives today are a due to their personal choices, not solely or necessarily the fault of the system
[8/19/19, 2:43:46 PM] Jonathan Ong: No I am, we just disagree that’s all
[8/19/19, 2:44:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: This is a big YIKES I’m sorry
[8/19/19, 2:44:15 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We’ll talk later hopefully
[8/19/19, 2:44:40 PM] Dev Naik: Ya I’m with this
[8/19/19, 2:44:43 PM] Dev Naik: This too
[8/19/19, 2:45:11 PM] Dev Naik: Times have changed
[8/19/19, 2:46:35 PM] Mohit Veligenti: If you think that it’s a choice that people are poor and continue to be or that there isn’t a system that doesn’t allow them to grow... i don’t know man. I think you need to watch more non conversative news sources or just non bias news sources though they are small.
[8/19/19, 2:46:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or just deal with poorer communities
[8/19/19, 2:47:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And that’s not me trying to slight you or call you closed minded
[8/19/19, 2:47:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But it’s just my thoughts
[8/19/19, 2:51:22 PM] Jonathan Ong: I do. I literally volunteered at a refugee center for two years. Syracuse is very economically disadvantaged in the area surrounding the school and I worked with all sorts of those patients from that area when I was volunteering/shadowing in the hospital. I understand what being poor means, hell my family was saving change to buy me a carton of milk when I was young when my dads company flopped and my parents were broke. U don’t know my story
[8/19/19, 2:51:58 PM] Jonathan Ong: People start out poor but they can change their circumstances if they work for it
[8/19/19, 3:10:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But you are generalizing and acting as though there’s always opportunities if you get your boots strapped and get to working. Your parents went through all the hoops and hey great for them, but they also had the privilege of being immigrants that had a company. There’s connections and networks they can reach out to. My parents did the same. They grinded and were damn near homeless. But got to where they are now. There’s a lot of people in America that don’t have that network or any assistance. Maybe they worked their ass off and I’m sure they did. But that success isn’t true all the time. There’s also a lot of people who work hard and have their opportunity taken from them by people who are more privileged. An example. There’s systems like decreased funding for public transportation not being funded, which causes poorer communities who can’t afford cars not be able to maintain jobs and get education. But then there’s increase in money for highways where richer people can use. There’s small tweaks and changes that don’t seem like a system, but it’s a system. 
And Jon of course I don’t know your story and hey, maybe you help everyone. But you are generalizing the story of every poor person as though they haven’t tried.
[8/19/19, 3:11:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Alright. I’m done for the day. I got called out by my instructor. ✌🏽 peace
[8/19/19, 3:12:26 PM] Dev Naik: 🙏🏾🙌🏾truth
[8/19/19, 3:14:10 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And hey jon, all love. Not trying to make me “more woke” or you dumber or something or that you haven’t been through anything. This just what I see from my perspective. We all on an equal plane. Glad I can find out more about you through convos like this.
[8/19/19, 3:15:09 PM] Dev Naik: This is also true!!🙌🏾🙏🏾
‎[8/19/19, 3:24:05 PM] Joe Stine: ‎image omitted
[8/19/19, 3:24:26 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Lol
[8/19/19, 3:24:44 PM] Dustin Bradley: Joe the meme lord
[8/19/19, 3:41:53 PM] Jonathan Ong: Aight this is my final point too bc I have to study lol. I think you’re misunderstanding my POV. I don’t think everyone has the same opportunities but I believe that if u work hard and work smart, those opportunities will come around. Gotta pay your dues. And my dad earned that privilege of owning a company at the time. He grinded for it, it wasn’t given to him. He worked his way from plumber to machinist to the moving industry to an opportunity that allowed him to own a moving company at the time. He earned his keep every step of the way, no one, not the government, no friends, nobody was there to help him or give him a free ride. He had no connections or networks to reach out to when he first immigrated here. He worked for it and earned it, just like everyone else, starting with no money. Same with poor ppl in America. I’m not generalizing for every poor person because the fact is not every poor person has tried, some do and some don’t. System has its flaws for sure, but u cannot tell me that all poor people in America from whatever race or ethnicity simply cannot be successful because the system is preventing them from doing so. People from disadvantaged backgrounds have made it in this country and continue to make it. I knew dirt poor kids, from black to white, who riding on 80%-full tuition scholarships at Syracuse bc they worked they’re asses off for it in whatever shitty run down  underfunded public schools they grew up in all across the country. They didn’t complain, they just worked. This has happened for decades and continues to happen. System isn’t perfect and we may disagree about how to change it but the current system does not dictate your future situation. U can rise from poverty as a child to middle class as an adult if u put in the hard work. Ppl need to stop complaining, stop blaming the system which will take more than a lifetime to improve, put their head down, and work. Also thanks @19259980019 @19256993963 @19256993454 @19258955572 for giving me a place to share my opinions without going at each others’ throats. Really enjoy it and it gets my mind churning
[8/19/19, 4:04:58 PM] Dev Naik: I believe it’s a little harder than putting in the most effort possible. But I do agree that the more effort put in, the more rewards will come from it. In a lot of circumstances unfortunately people just aren’t given the right or same opportunities. For example for the homeless, I have personally taken a class and have played a part in designing to help the unhoused. It’s not that they are not trying because there are so many people who try but just don’t have the right resources. Obviously there are the people are there because of their own doing like drugs, but so many people got there because of misfortune or even fleeing domestic abuse. Many people on the streets also turn to drugs because it’s what around them constantly and almost pushed onto them. As for the research I have done, it was researching who is homeless, how they are there, and what can be done give them a platform to get to that next step. It’s very difficult to find a job if you are camping out and have no real safe place to put your belongings. People go to job interviews and come back to find that the police have done a sweep and all of their belongings are gone and they are back in square 1. What I did research and helped improve designs for is transitional houseless villages which are just transitional housing for the homeless. They would stay in an environment where they are able to have a community and a more private area with a sense of ownership. They would stay there for a few months until they are able to get back on their feet, find a job, and save enough money to hopefully find a more stable place to live. Another issue with the homeless is the stigmatism and the lack of community connection with the housed and unhoused. I would love to go into more of what I learned and came up with but it’s just way easier in person haha. But that’s just a little glimpse. 

But yes thanks @19259180102 for a good conversation.
[8/19/19, 4:08:29 PM] Dev Naik: That was also probably very poorly worded lmao
[8/19/19, 4:10:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah that was trash dev. I don’t even know why you try. Just gross. Wow.
[8/19/19, 4:10:48 PM] Dev Naik: Rip
[8/19/19, 4:13:16 PM] Dustin Bradley: Well on the good side thank god there was no casualties i thought Jon was about to get a good curb stomp from the group chat
[8/19/19, 4:13:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: We all just having a discussion. No hard feelings here. Just opinions.
[8/19/19, 4:16:40 PM] Dev Naik: Yups
[8/19/19, 4:16:44 PM] Jonathan Ong: Well worded and u made some valid points, but it’s a continued discussion for another time
[8/19/19, 4:16:52 PM] Dev Naik: Haha yes
[8/19/19, 4:17:46 PM] Jonathan Ong: If that were the case, I can take it haha

[8/20/19, 2:17:22 PM] Cameron Freeman: I think I already know the answer To this and I already have an answer but just want to confirm. What would
Be a more intresting class in Thailand? Ecology and conservation or food processing ?
[8/20/19, 2:17:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dev what is your answer?
[8/20/19, 2:17:54 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because I think I know your answer
[8/20/19, 2:18:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Ecology and conservation. Would be my vote
[8/20/19, 2:18:25 PM] Cameron Freeman: That was mine
[8/20/19, 2:18:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: I think u thought I’d choose food processing
[8/20/19, 2:18:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Food processing is probably more interesting, but neither are great tbh
[8/20/19, 2:18:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I was talking about Dev lol
[8/20/19, 2:19:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And food processing may be better in learning more about where food comes from and how we consume it? So better for how you eat and maybe you learn how to cook more
[8/20/19, 2:20:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: cuz if I do food processing I won’t have a Monday class but if I do I will lol
[8/20/19, 2:20:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: But if I do ecology I will*
[8/20/19, 2:20:47 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So ecology means Monday class?
[8/20/19, 2:20:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yes
[8/20/19, 2:20:58 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Do food processing lol
[8/20/19, 2:21:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahahaha
[8/20/19, 2:21:12 PM] Cameron Freeman: Right!?
[8/20/19, 2:21:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It could be a nice class
[8/20/19, 2:21:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But ya gotta pay attention fosho
[8/20/19, 2:21:50 PM] Cameron Freeman: See idk if I can lol
[8/20/19, 2:22:06 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But ya gotta start learning now so you don’t slack when ya get to work
[8/20/19, 2:22:19 PM] Joe Stine: Just skip class
[8/20/19, 2:22:20 PM] Mohit Veligenti: To be honest I highly regret
[8/20/19, 2:22:33 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s Thailand. They’ll whoop his ass if he do lol
[8/20/19, 2:22:46 PM] Cameron Freeman: Regret what?
[8/20/19, 2:22:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Make him spend the night with lady boi
[8/20/19, 2:22:55 PM] Joe Stine: They gonna send the traps after him
[8/20/19, 2:22:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah attendance is 10% for that class
[8/20/19, 2:23:00 PM] Joe Stine: LOL

[8/20/19, 11:23:39 PM] Cameron Freeman: They mainly did it for their streaming service
[8/20/19, 11:24:00 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Lol spiderman is a cornerstone of the most expensive franchise in the world, and its disney
[8/20/19, 11:24:04 PM] Cameron Freeman: Like why Viacom and CBS just merged for their streaming service
[8/20/19, 11:24:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah but they wouldn’t buy the whole Sony for Spider-Man lol
[8/20/19, 11:24:27 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Guess we will see

[8/20/19, 11:28:52 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Oracle got such a horrible PR because of it

[8/21/19, 10:13:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That social media clout is heavy though can’t lie about that
[8/21/19, 10:13:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Us knowing that if anything just causes more of a panic. Our government won’t do shit. And our money can’t bring the trees or animals back to life

[8/21/19, 10:14:29 PM] Dev Naik: Also just something we should all not take for granted... if we can learn from this we can change more of our lifestyles to help this not happen again
[8/21/19, 10:14:44 PM] Dev Naik: But it can stop it from happening again with money in the right resources
[8/21/19, 10:15:00 PM] Mohit Veligenti: How so. Nobody posts about “hey don’t throw cigarettes on dry grass”
[8/21/19, 10:15:01 PM] Cameron Freeman: Thanks for letting me vent guys I needed to get that off my chest but didn’t want to be ripped by the feminists and just people who like to end people’s lives based in comments like this
[8/21/19, 10:15:08 PM] Cameron Freeman: Bro I’m so bored
[8/21/19, 10:15:26 PM] Cameron Freeman: How
[8/21/19, 10:15:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Increasing money in fire prevention. So on and so forth
[8/21/19, 10:15:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: There’s nothing we can do to prevent there from being a fire in Brazil
[8/21/19, 10:15:47 PM] Dev Naik: Putting more money in research of conservation
[8/21/19, 10:15:54 PM] Dev Naik: Learn

[8/21/19, 10:16:19 PM] Joe Stine: Ooh another political discussion 🍿
[8/21/19, 10:16:33 PM] Dustin Bradley: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[8/21/19, 10:16:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: No it’s not u. U may be part of it idr what u posted
[8/21/19, 10:16:57 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But who’s providing info/all the posting isn’t doing anything for being more informed. It’s just clout posts
[8/21/19, 10:16:58 PM] Dustin Bradley: ABOUT THE FIRES HAHAHAH
[8/21/19, 10:17:08 PM] Dustin Bradley: IN BRAZIL
[8/21/19, 10:17:15 PM] Cameron Freeman: I feel what ur saying Dev, but I don’t think any amount of money would stop prevent that because none of the people put the money towards that prevention
[8/21/19, 10:17:15 PM] Joe Stine: Just put that fire out lul
[8/21/19, 10:17:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah the fuck You bro wtf are we going to do about it
[8/21/19, 10:17:53 PM] Dev Naik: We need to realize every singe one of our actions causes a reaction. In this case it’s a severe issue for climate change and how our lifestyles are shit currently
[8/21/19, 10:18:05 PM] Cameron Freeman: Like there’s fires in califnoea one of the wealthiest states and best economies and they will just keep happening
[8/21/19, 10:18:09 PM] Dustin Bradley: Bro I can’t do shit
[8/21/19, 10:18:20 PM] Dustin Bradley: Just more awareness
[8/21/19, 10:18:22 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dawg but we understand. But where is there info to be able to help us “prevent the fires”
[8/21/19, 10:18:28 PM] Dev Naik: There are some people who are actually giving a fuck, but way too many who are there for the “clout”
[8/21/19, 10:18:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: I feel you but I think the fire is not 100% because of climate change. Now because of what all burned it will definitely effect it but there’s no amount of money or IG posts that will prevent another fire
[8/21/19, 10:19:03 PM] Mohit Veligenti: My point is that there are those people but like, I don’t see any info to help us “reflect”
[8/21/19, 10:19:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Or learn from this
[8/21/19, 10:19:17 PM] Dev Naik: It’s human caused
[8/21/19, 10:19:18 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I just see “OMG LOOK I CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT”
[8/21/19, 10:19:28 PM] Joe Stine: California
[8/21/19, 10:19:37 PM] Dev Naik: Facts tho unfortunately
[8/21/19, 10:19:43 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like dev, what can I do to prevent or help this not happen as much. Answer me that tho
[8/21/19, 10:19:53 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like give me websites and help. If there is any
[8/21/19, 10:19:55 PM] Dev Naik: But maybe if people start caring about it, people’s lifestyles an hopefully change
[8/21/19, 10:20:07 PM] Dev Naik: Live a more sustainable life
[8/21/19, 10:20:12 PM] Joe Stine: Dont use plastic straws. ;)
[8/21/19, 10:20:21 PM] Joe Stine: They kill sea turtles
[8/21/19, 10:20:23 PM] Dev Naik: Be greener
[8/21/19, 10:20:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: I feel you
[8/21/19, 10:20:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: I think they need to spread how the fire started more than the topic of focus he “omg there’s a fire and no one knew about it”
[8/21/19, 10:21:08 PM] Mohit Veligenti: YES
[8/21/19, 10:21:16 PM] Mohit Veligenti: That’s what I’m trying to say
[8/21/19, 10:21:29 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sorry I just got back from the gym and I’m kinda hangry and tired.
[8/21/19, 10:21:37 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Sorry for being aggressive lol
[8/21/19, 10:21:47 PM] Cameron Freeman: Because yeah Dev ur right I googled it and the rainforest has been “fire resistant” for much of its history because of its natural moisture and humidity but NASA said drought and human activities are causing wildfires
[8/21/19, 10:21:51 PM] Dev Naik: More so how can we change for this not to happen
[8/21/19, 10:22:00 PM] Dev Naik: It’s always the case
[8/21/19, 10:22:02 PM] Cameron Freeman: Ur not being aggressive all good lol
[8/21/19, 10:22:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Fosho

[8/21/19, 10:22:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: Kept building up every time someone posted a new thing about it
[8/21/19, 10:22:38 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yessss
[8/21/19, 10:22:42 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Cameron, that’s disgusting. You don’t care about the environment. You probably don’t care about women’s rights either
[8/21/19, 10:22:44 PM] Cameron Freeman: Like always 😜
[8/21/19, 10:22:51 PM] Cameron Freeman: Hahahahaha see there it is!
[8/21/19, 10:23:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: DO YOU EVEN RECYCLE
[8/21/19, 10:23:30 PM] Dev Naik: It is funny tho to see all these people who don’t know anything about the environment posting about it. It will be great if this changed peoples perspectives tho to be the change the world needs
[8/21/19, 10:23:55 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yeah exaclty like bitch you don’t even have a hydro flask Whatchu doin?
[8/21/19, 10:24:02 PM] Dev Naik: Lmao
[8/21/19, 10:24:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[8/21/19, 10:24:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: They are so cheap
[8/21/19, 10:24:09 PM] Dev Naik: But hopefully now they will get one
[8/21/19, 10:24:13 PM] Mohit Veligenti: All I use are hydroflasks too
[8/21/19, 10:24:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: After seeing the Amazon posts 103362 times
[8/21/19, 10:24:32 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Like motherfucker I put alcohol in a Hydroflask too
[8/21/19, 10:24:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I am environmentally aware and drunk
[8/21/19, 10:24:48 PM] Cameron Freeman: Yo not being funny this is great free marketing for amazon
[8/21/19, 10:24:51 PM] Dev Naik: Yes I think it’s good tho because it really distilled fear that we are fucking up currently lol
[8/21/19, 10:25:03 PM] Cameron Freeman: Someone hear amazon on fire
[8/21/19, 10:25:09 PM] Dev Naik: And shows we really need to change
[8/21/19, 10:25:10 PM] Cameron Freeman: They like what we better order our shit ASAP
[8/21/19, 10:25:12 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Amazon fire stick?
[8/21/19, 10:25:29 PM] Cameron Freeman: And they google search amazon and boom amazon.com pops up
[8/21/19, 10:25:36 PM] Cameron Freeman: They probably started the fire
[8/21/19, 10:25:43 PM] Cameron Freeman: Bro what?!
[8/21/19, 10:26:42 PM] Dustin Bradley: Idk it had alcohol in it 🤷🏻‍♂
[8/21/19, 10:29:21 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Dustin ruins memes for me
[8/21/19, 10:29:22 PM] Dev Naik: But on the real, this really hurts me on a crazy level. It’s been a dream since I was a kid to go Brazil and visit the Amazon and the Pantanal to learn from the incredibly diverse environment and wildlife for inspiration for designs. It’s just so sad that at the moment a vast majority of the Amazon is burning and so much of the biodiversity is getting destroyed all because of human activity. 😢💔
[8/21/19, 10:31:55 PM] Dev Naik: I’m sorry for getting serious about this, but it’s a massive part of who I am and it aches to see that our lifestyles are such a negative impact on the world we live in
[8/21/19, 10:37:35 PM] Cameron Freeman: I’m sorry bro 🙈 I can’t imagine.
[8/21/19, 10:37:58 PM] Cameron Freeman: No bro don’t apoligize for that!! I feel that Forsure
[8/21/19, 10:49:42 PM] Dev Naik: ❤
[8/21/19, 11:44:07 PM] Owen Gilbert: The reason people are freaking out about it is because the fire has been going on for weeks and theres been nothing about it since the past couple days...and the president is kind of a cuck about it too. And ya there isnt much we can do about it but that's not why people are mad. It was started by people, it wasnt natural. And the fire is big enough that the smoke has reached like the entire continent. Thats why you're reading it everywhere cam.
[8/22/19, 12:33:28 AM] Cameron Freeman: Thanks bro yeah still don’t sticking with my position lol. I knew all of this when I took my stand Hahahah

[8/22/19, 2:06:27 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: What do you guys think about logging companies clearing brushes to help the problem of wildfires? I know the topic was the Amazon rainforest, but we have a huge wildfire problem in CA
[8/22/19, 2:08:07 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I heard an argument that logging, in a controlled and non corporate greedy manner, is super beneficial for the environment. Not only would it help the dying logging industry in CA (i.e. create jobs), but itll also help in containing wildfires when they happen
[8/22/19, 2:13:41 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Idk just something to think about
[8/22/19, 6:30:50 AM] Dev Naik: Yes logging can be done in a very economical and beneficial way. It works more so with trees but the concept works the same in limitation. What would work the best in California would be controlled burns to make fire lines
[8/22/19, 9:47:38 AM] Dustin Bradley: Boom Dev you are exactly right it almost like a reset button
[8/22/19, 10:38:59 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: You can have a combination of both, but do you know why we currently dont have that. Its becuase of "environmental" superpacs that prohibit the "destruction" of wildlife
[8/22/19, 10:55:33 AM] Dev Naik: I’m not so sure about that. Most environmentalists understand we still need resources. Logging can be done in a very sustainable way that still preserves very important habitat and wildlife. The issue is that when we do log it’s been mostly clear cutting in sensitive areas. We need to be cutting only specified trees and planting right after so it’s a cycle where there will constantly be trees of all varying ages.
[8/22/19, 11:59:12 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Yo I know we talking about stuff involving the environment
[8/22/19, 11:59:15 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But man fuck taxes lol
[8/22/19, 11:59:21 AM] Mohit Veligenti: Fucking bullshit
[8/22/19, 11:59:31 AM] Mohit Veligenti: I feel personally attacked on my first paycheck
[8/22/19, 12:16:18 PM] Jonathan Ong: California’s the worst bc we got the highest state income tax
[8/22/19, 12:16:45 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah
[8/22/19, 12:16:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Income tax was whatever
[8/22/19, 12:17:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Federal killed like 40% of my paycheck
[8/22/19, 12:18:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Do you have retirement stuff? All of that is taken out
[8/22/19, 12:19:09 PM] Jonathan Ong: There’s no way federal is 40%

[8/22/19, 12:33:24 PM] Mohit Veligenti: My bonus got fucked
[8/22/19, 12:33:38 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Pre tax I only have 50 bucks being taken out
[8/22/19, 12:34:12 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: What about 401k and stuff
[8/22/19, 12:34:42 PM] Jonathan Ong: And health insurance
[8/22/19, 12:36:04 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Haven’t set up 401k yet. And health insurance is 30 bucks. It included in that 50 I said
[8/22/19, 12:36:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I’m telling you. I read through this shit lol. Taxes got me fucked. I know my finances well lol
[8/22/19, 12:36:46 PM] Jonathan Ong: Wait so your bonus got fucked but how about your normal pay check
[8/22/19, 12:36:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s all in one payslip. Not separated
[8/22/19, 12:37:07 PM] Mohit Veligenti: So you can’t see which got taxed how
[8/22/19, 12:37:40 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: You should be able to bring it up to your hr
[8/22/19, 12:37:42 PM] Jonathan Ong: So they added it all into a single deduction?
[8/22/19, 12:38:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Nah it’s not an HR thing. It’s taxes. I looked it up. I guess bonuses are taxes differently
[8/22/19, 12:38:05 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yes
[8/22/19, 12:38:22 PM] Jonathan Ong: Yikes
[8/22/19, 12:38:36 PM] Mohit Veligenti: I would but ehh I know its just the way it is. I can’t do anything about it
[8/22/19, 12:38:59 PM] Mohit Veligenti: And it’s Uncle Sam deciding. So workday can’t do shit
[8/22/19, 12:39:12 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They decide the bonus though dont they?
[8/22/19, 12:39:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah
[8/22/19, 12:40:00 PM] Jonathan Ong: Why don’t u just ask for more info? It doesn’t hurt to know how everything was taxed
[8/22/19, 12:41:30 PM] Joe Stine: My dad when he gets a bonus usually loses 50% to taxes, so I dont know how much uncle sam yoinked from you lmao
[8/22/19, 12:41:44 PM] Joe Stine: Just gonna move to UAE and work a tax free job
[8/22/19, 12:41:46 PM] Chris Cheng: Its the same for me
[8/22/19, 12:41:55 PM] Chris Cheng: I think about 40% taken from my bonus
[8/22/19, 12:44:34 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Yeah about 40

[9/6/19, 5:20:00 AM] Dustin Bradley: Hey guys I know it’s late but I wanted to ask who here has heard of “AJ+”?
[9/6/19, 5:44:31 AM] Dustin Bradley: It was an add on youtube but it peaked my interest because it’s a news reporting system from Quatar that borders Israel and supports terrorist groups. From the video it said that it targets young Americans so that in the future it will weaken our likelihood to defend a country we don’t like. For example, the black lives matter movement, this pro terrorist social media news group supports these movement like “Me Two” as well as “BLM” to gain trust and support from the young and naive Americans and to hate on our government  “not that it doesn’t need fixing of course”, but that’s ironic. Because this so called AJ+ news group is run by these people who support pro Islamic terrorism and hate America and want to weaken us from within and where does that start, with the younger generation of Americans who us social media on a daily basis. Lets face the facts, it’s more of a necessity than a need anymore. It’s scary to think that they are still doing this today and nothing is being done about it and there is no under the water operation, they’re just doing it out in the plain open it ludicrous!
[9/6/19, 5:45:47 AM] Dustin Bradley: I think this is can be an interesting conversation
[9/6/19, 7:05:32 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: Uhhh, no clue where to start with my thinking there
[9/6/19, 8:12:16 AM] Dev Naik: Same

[9/6/19, 4:28:52 PM] Joe Stine: Any1 free to hang tonight

[9/6/19, 6:16:50 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Well its the same way that the Russian government was able to infiltrate the 2016 Elections. They would set up fake facebook groups for both BLM and white nationalist movements and create fake rage to fuel American hunger for controversy. That's just weaponizing fear and it's really up to us not get caught up in it.
[9/6/19, 6:17:58 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: That's why developing critical thinking is more important than ever
[9/6/19, 6:18:24 PM] Jonathan Ong: I get my news strictly from buzzfeed.. does that count?
[9/6/19, 6:18:40 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Come on
[9/6/19, 6:18:44 PM] Mohit Veligenti: At least use Facebook
[9/6/19, 6:18:48 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s the most reliable
[9/6/19, 6:19:47 PM] Jonathan Ong: Meh.. the most reliable is Snapchat imo
[9/6/19, 6:27:02 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Snapchat news reports are the best
[9/6/19, 6:27:09 PM] Mohit Veligenti: TMZ is where it’s really at
[9/6/19, 6:27:14 PM] Mohit Veligenti: But only TMZ on Snapchat

[9/6/19, 6:31:46 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: Also @19257847841 I'm not trying to be a dick, but if you're going to send a long content heavy message, atleast proofread. Spelling errors hinder our ability to understand what you are trying to say, and if its riddled with errors people will take it less seriously or just write it off.
[9/6/19, 6:32:51 PM] Mohit Veligenti: It’s hard to read and makes me not wanna read it sometimes because I gotta put thought into reading it.

[9/12/19, 1:35:25 PM] Mohit Veligenti: Because having a filling it hard af so they layer it between cake layers. Not fill it. So it’s still part of the cake

[10/22/19, 2:52:17 AM] Joe Stine: Lmao they removed presentiging from the new COD. @19257847841 time to refund considering they arent giving us spec ops and they are adding loot boxes again
[10/22/19, 2:52:47 AM] Joe Stine: Being able to Prestige***
[10/22/19, 2:53:09 AM] Jonathan Ong: Thought spec ops was coming out with it
[10/22/19, 2:53:55 AM] Joe Stine: Only on PS4
[10/22/19, 2:54:04 AM] Dustin Bradley: Actually no your wrong we get spec ops just not survival and there are no loot boxes they removed it from the game and it’s from an official source
[10/22/19, 2:54:05 AM] Joe Stine: PC players and Xbox get cucked
[10/22/19, 2:54:19 AM] Jonathan Ong: That makes no sense tho
[10/22/19, 2:54:39 AM] Joe Stine: It does because Activision has a deal with Sony.
[10/22/19, 2:54:49 AM] Joe Stine: We get spec ops in one year.
[10/22/19, 2:55:04 AM] Jonathan Ong: No way
[10/22/19, 2:55:08 AM] Jonathan Ong: Sucks
[10/22/19, 2:55:25 AM] Joe Stine: Look up the officer rank system lmao, they removed prestiges
[10/22/19, 2:55:38 AM] Dustin Bradley: No we get spec ops just not survival
[10/22/19, 2:56:03 AM] Joe Stine: IN ONE YEAR WE GET SPEC OPS. ONE YEAR
[10/22/19, 2:57:08 AM] Dustin Bradley: Joe there’s a difference between spec ops and survival mode
[10/22/19, 2:57:28 AM] Dustin Bradley: Wait till the game comes out to judge it
[10/22/19, 2:57:53 AM] Dustin Bradley: Where are you getting your info from
[10/22/19, 2:57:58 AM] Joe Stine: ???????? I never said anything about survival. Legit I only said something about spec ops. And yes I know the difference. We dont get survival at all, and we dont get spec ops for a year.
[10/22/19, 2:58:50 AM] Dustin Bradley: Joe yes we do get spec ops what are you talking about look at your downloads on your computer
[10/22/19, 2:59:17 AM] Joe Stine: WhErE aRe U gEtTing your info from
[10/22/19, 2:59:52 AM] Joe Stine: Lmao never mind. Game is gonna flop because of all these post beta decisions they are making for a moneygrab.
[10/22/19, 3:00:26 AM] Dustin Bradley: Joe are you memeing me
[10/22/19, 3:00:52 AM] Dustin Bradley: I promise you we will have spec ops just not the survival
[10/22/19, 3:01:18 AM] Joe Stine: On release no. Ill bet
[10/22/19, 3:01:22 AM] Joe Stine: 1000 dollars
[10/22/19, 3:02:13 AM] Dustin Bradley: I don’t have 1000 and I bet nothing cause I’m cheap and a bitch
[10/22/19, 3:03:39 AM] Joe Stine: Im MeMeing because Im dissappointed with all these terrible decisions and how theyre going to ruin a game that was supposed to save the franchise.
[10/22/19, 3:03:42 AM] Dustin Bradley: JOE LOOK AT YOUR DOWNLOADS IT SAYS SPEC OPS PACK 1 and 2
[10/22/19, 3:07:34 AM] Dustin Bradley: Yes agreed but let’s just wait and see man I’ve been watching a tone of videos about it and the whole changes with the system also the DLC have a shit tone of new game mode also returning ones that made this franchise great
[10/22/19, 3:08:05 AM] Joe Stine: The main thing that ruins it is the removal of prestige, now its an officer system that unlocks loot/skins on the battle pass. Turning the game into Fortnite.
[10/22/19, 3:08:18 AM] Joe Stine: 🤡 shit
[10/22/19, 3:11:36 AM] Dustin Bradley: Joe look up on YouTube preskigekey he explains everything about the new system and the grind it will take and why it’s worth it. look at all his recently new MW videos
[10/22/19, 3:13:27 AM] Dustin Bradley: JOE!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[10/22/19, 3:13:48 AM] Dustin Bradley: Come on man I think your gonna like the change give it a chance
[10/22/19, 3:17:30 AM] Dustin Bradley: There’s so much more weapon customization and over 30 attachment for each gun also it’s cross modes meaning whatever  unlocks you unlock in Campaign, spec ops, or multiplayer it will be available through all modes
[10/23/19, 8:39:24 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Irving drops 50 in game 1 and sends to OT, god i love this

I see a girl holding her little sister talking to the golfland employee. “Hmm. Her hand looks odd” turn back and mind my own business. My girl and I both hear “hey can you guys help us, we called 911. My sister snapped her wrist” we both turn back around. This little girl’s wrist was literally snapped backwards, damn near perpendicular/orthogonal. Fuck. My. Life. We smacked the button for whatever golf ball and went to the course. A fire truck and an ambulance and they stabilized her and took her away. Mother. Fuck. Man.

[11/15/19, 2:47:28 PM] Dev Naik: I wouldn’t unfollow him...
[11/15/19, 2:49:52 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: After a little research there are 2 possibilities. Either you got hacked or some 3rd party service is following/unfollowing accounts on behalf of your profile
[11/15/19, 2:50:19 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Or bug
[11/15/19, 2:51:21 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: "Instagram accounts will never unfollow or follow people on there own"
[11/15/19, 2:51:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: They are owned by facebook so eh
[11/15/19, 2:51:47 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: But ya probabaly a bug
[11/15/19, 2:51:53 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I was just about say that
[11/15/19, 2:53:53 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: @19256993454 I would check which 3rd party services you allow access to your account
[11/15/19, 3:00:09 PM] Dev Naik: Roooooough

[11/15/19, 3:04:26 PM] Dev Naik: I will just at work right now
[11/15/19, 3:07:02 PM] Owen Gilbert: Blocking someone cause them to unfollow you as well as you to unfollow them. If someone blocks and unblocks you it'll look like you both never followed each other
[11/15/19, 3:07:07 PM] Dustin Bradley: Hahah Thanks Jon they gonna love this virgin dick
[11/15/19, 3:07:21 PM] Owen Gilbert: Causes*

[11/15/19, 3:11:16 PM] Dev Naik: It could also be I accidentally unfollowed him??

[11/24/19, 11:48:41 PM] Joe Stine: Dodged ♿
[11/25/19, 2:34:16 AM] Cameron Freeman: Okay Timmy. I think you need to reflect and ask yourself what you are trying to achieve. You are my “friend” so I do not understand why from the beggening when I first mentioned I am coming instead of being a friend you immediately started attacking me and questioning my loyalty? And then now with this comment about trying to get sympathy points? You sound like a dick and I’m not here for it. Ima take it back to elementary school, if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything at all.
[11/25/19, 2:35:48 AM] Cameron Freeman: I guess I didn’t know what was meant by infrastructure and Ofcourse I care, you were being an ass per usual and I was pre occupied so I was saying whatver I could to get u to piss off.
[11/25/19, 9:58:35 AM] Dev Naik: I think Tim is actually trying to help you become more aware. We are all friends and I believe we are all trying to make each other better people so in this case he is attempting to inform you about the everyday struggles the people of China go through. I too believe it is a little ignorant to go to a country where people are suffering to go have your own pleasure, pretty much supporting the larger government in charge there. I do wish you are safe and are having fun nonetheless because you are my friend, but I believe Timmy is just disappointed because he and the rest of us know you are better than that. I think it’s good of friends to challenge each other to be better individuals, and that’s what I see happening in this instance.
[11/25/19, 10:09:21 AM] Mohit Veligenti: ^ maybe Timmy was a little harsher than most, but that’s just how we are. We need to challenge each other so we all learn new shit all the time. I think Dev makes a great point.
[11/25/19, 10:10:12 AM] Dev Naik: I would probably agree that Tim was a little harsh haha
[11/25/19, 10:10:32 AM] Mohit Veligenti: But hey, sometimes you need the harshness to get your point across.
[11/25/19, 10:11:17 AM] Dev Naik: True
[11/25/19, 10:30:06 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: I told him he was being too harsh
[11/25/19, 10:30:51 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: But this was definitely his point, which is why I emphasized the post
[11/25/19, 11:42:21 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: To clear up a couple things. The first thing I asked you was why you were in Hong Kong. I challenged your reasoning behind why you were going to HK and Disneyland of all places. I never questioned your loyalty. I said "your lack of empathy is un-american", and "you call yourself a liberal". Both in response to you calling protestors, who are being shot in the street, not civilians. That made you sound like a dick. You said you dont give a fuck about HK. Lastly, after a comment I made about free speech you replied with a sarcastic "Nice!". 

Actually Cameron if I didnt care for you as my friend, I would never ask you these questions. I would never ask you to be safe, twice. I wouldent challenge you on your personal beliefs. I'm not a "yes man". 

I am trying to understand what is your point. You say you dont care about HK, you make a comment about protestors not being civilians and then you make a insta post about how "resilient HK" is. Especially on a picture that says "Fear became the tool of this government". That picture alone says a thousand words. It says why we should care!
[11/25/19, 11:44:20 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: 100% my point. We are friends. We have to challenge each other.
[11/25/19, 11:52:10 AM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: This is an issue I care about a lot. I think we as Americans should care. If you really cared you wouldent say whatever just to get me to piss off. You would have shown it.
[11/25/19, 11:54:06 AM] Ethan  Lipsker: ^ you really did come off as un-empathetic Cam. Regardless of how Tim may have talked about it or addressed it, you definitely acted on a pedestal and it pissed me off too.
[11/25/19, 7:40:09 PM] Cameron Freeman: I say I’m going to Disneyland and you automatically call me naive. You start saying facts regarding the protests as if I had no idea like no shit I’m aware of the protests u were talking to me like a dumbass and like I didn’t know anything. I was literally there idk what you wanted to come from saying what you were saying I couldn’t leave. And okay I think that was a huge miscommunication that made you belive I was a dick. When you guys said they were shooting civilians. I thought you were saying they were shooting innocent civilians as in I would just get shot walking down the street and me saying not civilians meant not innocent civilians they were only shooting people involved and protesting. I wasn’t trying to say protestors are not civilians if that makes sense.

I did not say I don’t care about Hong Kong. I said I didn’t give about their economic infrastructure I don’t even know what that means and I said it as in my decision to go to Disneyland isn’t determined based on their economic infrastructure. And while in Hong Kong I saw so much and learned a lot and saw how resilient they were.

You immediately took everything way to seriously and to heart and started questioning my stances and loyalties to my country and party?
[11/25/19, 7:41:19 PM] Cameron Freeman: Sorry to say but that’s how you read it and decided to see it. Couldn’t have more love for Hong Kong
[11/25/19, 7:41:41 PM] Ethan  Lipsker: Thats how everyone read it
[11/25/19, 7:55:15 PM] Joe Stine: 🍿
[11/25/19, 8:50:05 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: 1. Again let's clarify some arguments here. You said "I didnt look at the news becuase I didnt want it to ruin my trip". This is why I sent you news for what was happening becuase you *said* you were purposely avoiding the news. 

2. *Protestors are innocent civilians* your argument doesn't make any sense. *Civilains are innocent people by defenition*. Imagine black people protesting crooked cops and police killing protestors. Are those not innocent civilians? And police harrased, intimidated, and beat up civilians who were just trying to go to work. Take a second to reflect on what you just said becuase it is preposterous, and I know you dont believe it.

3. We both took everything to heart, so we can be both to blame. Look up the defenition of "liberal". It screams I stand with HK which you didnt communicate at all. You didnt care to discuss anything I said seriously. 

4. Again you sound like your back-pedaling but I can agree that it was mostly a miscommunication. 

5. Lastly, you questioned our friendship. Over just me calling you naive for going to Disneyland. Imagine how insane that is. I'm hurt and I know you didnt mean it that way but nobody uses friend in quotation marks like that
[11/25/19, 8:59:24 PM] Cameron Freeman: 1. Yes it was a joke I didn’t know you were going to take everything so personally and to heart and make it so serious 

2. My argument makes perfect sense. They were not peacefully protesting they were being violent. I was saying that the cops were only attacking protestors being violent and not attacking people just walking randomly. You really had to bring up Black people protesting really??? Take as much time as you need to reflect on what you just said and what I said again because I don’t think you are trying to understand you are believing and seeing it how you want to see it and not trying to understand how I meant it. 

3. Because my intentions were not to have a serious ass talk all I was saying was giving my homies an update I didn’t need a history lesson I’m very aware of what’s happening I didn’t want to have a serious discussion. and because you didn’t say anything you just attacked and accused so I’m going to go on the defense obviously. 

5. I 100% meant it that way. If you were my friend you would try and give me the benefit of the doubt and understand where I was coming from instead of assuming the worst and accusing me of not caring and being naive. That hurt a lot.

[11/25/19, 9:10:43 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: 1. If it's a joke say its a joke. Nobody can tell over text. Again miscommunication as I have pointed out
2. No your argument doesnt make sense. I am trying to understand it from your point of view. Why else would I say "black protests"?  Peaceful protests escalates into violent protests especially when the gov is China. You're still not standing with HK by this argument. 
3. By saying what you said you escalated the argument. 
4/5. Good to know all it takes to question a 10 year friendship is a simple opposition to view point.

You both need to take a step back and really just take a look at the situation.. poor communication on both sides with the miscommunication and stupid shit was said by both of y’all.

[11/25/19, 9:32:30 PM] Cameron Freeman: You questioned my loyalty to my country and my political party 😑 I don’t have to question your loyalty to your friends because you just showed that.

[11/25/19, 9:38:25 PM] Dustin Bradley: @19258955572 @15858201670 what happened cannot be undone but what can be done is learn from this situation and grow from it. You both are adults and both really good friends and my friend. I most sincerely believe that when this comes to pass you both will look back and say WOW WE SAID THAT, HOW STUPID??!
[11/25/19, 9:39:09 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: For the fourth time I did not. Talk about seeing it from another person's perspective. I was addressing your comments about you saying protestors arent civilians
[11/25/19, 9:39:58 PM] Dustin Bradley: Time is the best healer so use it and reflect love you both ❤ @19258955572 @15858201670
[11/25/19, 9:41:06 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: I dont think anything I said was stupid but I'm willing to say it was miscommunication.
[11/25/19, 9:42:54 PM] Tim Aka Professor Snowangel 🇷🇺🥦🥦 Smaluk: If you're going to be mad about me supposedly questioning your political and party beliefs than you can be mad for no reason. In willing to reconcile becuase *that's what friends do*
[11/25/19, 9:46:13 PM] Dustin Bradley: Not that Tim I’m talking about how both you and cam are letting your emotions get the best of you, hence why I said time is the best healer
[11/25/19, 9:49:04 PM] Dustin Bradley: *each other
